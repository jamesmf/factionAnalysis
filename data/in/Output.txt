The nuclear agreement highlights the limits of American power-something the president's opponents won't accept.

"Mankind faces a crossroads," declared Woody Allen. "One path leads to despair and utter hopelessness. The other, to total extinction. Let us pray we have the wisdom to choose correctly."
The point is simple: In life, what matters most isn't how a decision compares to your ideal outcome. It's how it compares to the alternative at hand.
The same is true for the Iran deal, announced Tuesday between Iran and six world powers. As Congress begins debating the agreement, its opponents have three real alternatives. The first is to kill the deal, and the interim agreement that preceded it, and do nothing else, which means few restraints on Iran's nuclear program. The second is war. But top American and Israeli officials have warned that military action against Iranian nuclear facilities could ignite a catastrophic regional conflict and would be ineffective, if not counterproductive, in delaying Iran's path to the bomb. Meir Dagan, who oversaw the Iran file as head of Israel's external spy agency, the Mossad, from 2002 to 2011, has said an attack "would mean regional war, and in that case you would have given Iran the best possible reason to continue the nuclear program." Michael Hayden, who ran the CIA under George W. Bush from 2006 to 2009, has warned that an attack would "guarantee that which we are trying to prevent: an Iran that will spare nothing to build a nuclear weapon."
'Look ... It's My Name on This': Obama Defends the Iran Nuclear DealImplicitly acknowledging this, most critics of the Iran deal propose a third alternative: increase sanctions in hopes of forcing Iran to make further concessions. But in the short term, the third alternative looks a lot like the first. Whatever its deficiencies, the Iran deal places limits on Iran's nuclear program and enhances oversight of it. Walk away from the agreement in hopes of getting tougher restrictions and you're guaranteeing, at least for the time being, that there are barely any restrictions on the program at all.
What's more, even if Congress passes new sanctions, it's quite likely that the overall economic pressure on Iran will go down, not up. Most major European and Asian countries have closer economic ties to Iran than does the United States, and thus more domestic pressure to resume them. These countries have abided by international sanctions against Iran, to varying degrees, because the Obama administration convinced their leaders that sanctions were a necessary prelude to a diplomatic deal. If U.S. officials reject a deal, Iran's historic trading partners will not economically injure themselves indefinitely. Sanctions, declared Britain's ambassador to the United States in May, have already reached "the high-water mark," noting that "you would probably see more sanctions erosion" if nuclear talks fail. Germany's ambassador added that, "If diplomacy fails, then the sanctions regime might unravel."
The nuclear agreement signed between Iran and the P5+1 (United States, Russia, China, United Kingdom, France, Germany) will remain a point of contention in Washington for many years to come. Supporters of the deal claim that it will effectively constrain and roll back Iran's nuclear efforts while providing space for meaningful change in Iran. Critics claim that the deal leaves most of Iran's nuclear infrastructure intact and does not compel the Iranian government to change its regional policies and behavior at home. The nuclear agreement is not perfect and certainly does not attain the ideals of either side. However, on balance, it prevents Iran from developing a nuclear weapons capability in the near future while giving some space for Iranian proponents of change. The nuclear deal is a pragmatic necessity rather than a panacea.
The nuclear agreement, nearly 100 pages, is long on technical details that will be parsed by highly experienced non-proliferation experts. But it has several components that diminish and limit Iran's nuclear capabilities. According to the agreement, Iran has decided to drastically cut back on its number of centrifuges. The Fordow facility, built under a mountain and impervious to most military options, will be turned into a research and science facility, a smart compromise between Iran and the P5+1. The Arak heavy water reactor will be modified so it cannot be used for production of nuclear weapons. And Iran agrees to keep its stockpile of enriched uranium to a minimum. The Iranian nuclear program will also come under the close scrutiny of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). Critics have claimed that Iran should be subjected to "anytime, anywhere" inspections, but it is completely unrealistic to expect any sovereign country undefeated in war to accept such measures. Iran may object to IAEA requests for inspections, but a majority of the P5+1 can overrule its objections. This is a formula that gives a clear advantage to the United States.
Iran must comply with the agreement before it receives sanctions relief; it will not receive a "signing bonus" for signing the agreement, as critics have claimed. Over time, Iran may repatriate nearly $150 billion of its own funds, which have been "frozen" within the international financial system due to nuclear sanctions. This is a reasonable quid pro quo. Iran rolls back its nuclear program for sanctions relief. President Hassan Rouhani seeks to spend much of this money and any future oil proceeds on Iran's ailing economy; he was elected on a platform of improving living standards for the average Iranian. However, Iran's highly corrupt political establishment, including the Revolutionary Guards, is likely to take its cut of the economic windfall. Some of Iran's sanctions relief may also be spent on Iran's regional activities, although Iran's domestic needs are likely to outweigh expenditures for foreign adventures.
The nuclear deal will not transform Iran. Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and the Revolutionary Guards will maintain control and attempt to prevent any meaningful changes. Rouhani, while pragmatic enough to sign a nuclear deal, is also cautious enough not to make any sudden moves that could jolt the political system and undermine his own political authority. But millions of Iranians that seek change will be given more space to breath. The 2009 mass Green Movement demonstrated a thirst for change in Iran. Iranians have been waiting for a deal for years, but they, more than anyone, are realistic enough to realize its limitations.
The deal is not perfect. The strongest limitations on Iran's nuclear program will last 10 to 15 years. Iran will be more free to expand its nuclear program after that period, but it will still remain under international inspections. And a deal will not change the Iranian regime or its support for anti-American forces in the Middle East. However, the nuclear deal is a first step for change in Iran. Change may be slow to come, as Iranians have long expected. After all, the 1979 revolution, seemingly sudden and full of promise, transformed Iran forever and for the worse as many Iranians are concerned. So slow changes may be the best option for them. Washington, for now, has come to the same conclusion. Positive change in Iran cannot be achieved through war, sanctions, and unending pressure. It will take incremental steps. The nuclear deal, while not perfect, is a step in the right direction.

How to make sense of the nuclear deal with Iran? Is it a necessary compromise that's preferable to the alternatives and potentially beneficial for the Middle East? A feeble and indefensible sop to Iranian leaders bent on further destabilizing the region? A practically satisfying but morally troubling gamble, born of bad options? The Atlantic's Peter Beinart, David Frum, and Jeffrey Goldberg debate the new agreement-and the swift and fierce reaction to it.
Peter Beinart: David and Jeff, the thing that strikes me most about the reaction to the Iran deal is that proponents and opponents are judging it by radically different standards.
Opponents keep saying that this deal isn't as good as the Obama administration promised it would be and that it violates previous U.S. red lines. That's true. It allows Iran to keep some enriched uranium. It also doesn't include anytime, anywhere, right-away inspections, which I think the Obama administration was foolish to promise (a kind of parallel to when they said no one would lose coverage as a result of Obamacare).
Was the Iran Deal Worth It?Proponents, like myself, compare it to the alternatives: which are doing nothing, war, or trying to increase sanctions in hopes of getting a better deal down the line. What frustrates me is how rarely I see opponents explaining in any detail how any of these alternatives would be preferable. A few years ago, one saw more hawks arguing for a military strike. ( I detailed some of the folks who did last year.) But one rarely hears anyone these days arguing that a military strike makes sense. Some say that a "credible threat of force" would make Iran concede more. But Israel and America have been threatening force for a decade now. Why would more saber-rattling work now? Besides, to have your threat of force be credible, don't you have to be willing to follow through-which requires explaining why military action would be effective in retarding the nuclear program and wouldn't make the current regional conflict far worse? More often, deal opponents talk about increasing sanctions, which would supposedly force Iran into concessions. But I rarely hear them explain how that will work given the internal politics of Iran. Seems more likely to me that scuttling this deal, and passing more sanctions, would devastate [Iranian President] Rouhani and [Iranian Foreign Minister] Zarif politically. Rouhani was elected to improve the economy; torpedoing the deal would make him a failure. That would empower those hardline opponents who never wanted any deal. Beyond that, what basis is there to believe European and Asian countries, which have strong economic interests in Iran, will maintain sanctions indefinitely? The lesson of Iraq in the 1990s is that sanctions erode over time. British and German diplomats have warned that if the U.S. destroys the deal, sanctions could unravel. So why should we believe economic pressure will go up and lead to more Iranian concessions? Seems at least as likely to me that economic pressure will go down.
I also don't feel that opponents of the deal-who waxed moralistic about Obama's failure to be vocal enough in supporting the Green Revolution-have grappled much publicly with what appears to be the overwhelming support of Iranian dissidents for this deal. If we believe that ultimately the most important thing is the potential for political change in Iran, and the people who would make that change want this deal, doesn't that carry real weight? (I'm not saying this deal will bring political change anytime soon. Obviously, nobody knows if it will.) Call me cynical, but seems to me that hawks like using the Iranian dissidents when it helps them argue for a cold-war posture. But the minute it doesn't, they pretend those dissidents don't exist.
David Frum: What did the Western world get from the nuclear deal just concluded with Iran?
According to deal proponents-and assuming Iran does not cheat-a delay of about eight months in Iran's nuclear-breakout time, for a period of 10 years.
1) It has rescued Iran from the extreme economic crisis into which it was pushed by the sanctions imposed in January 2012-sanctions opposed at the time by the Obama administration, lest anyone has forgotten.
2) It has relaxed the arms embargo on Iran. Iran will be able to buy conventional arms soon, ballistic-missile components later.
3) It has exempted Iranian groups and individuals from terrorist designations, freeing them to travel and do business around the world.
4) It has promised to protect the Iranian nuclear program from sabotage by outside parties-meaning, pretty obviously, Israel.
5) It has ended the regime's isolation, conceding to the Iranian theocracy the legitimacy that the Iranian revolution has forfeited since 1979 by its consistent and repeated violations of the most elementary international norms-including, by the way, its current detention of four America hostages.
That seems one-sided. Deal proponents insist: With all its imperfections, this is the very best deal obtainable. The only practical alternative is war.
The United States did not negotiate the way people negotiate to get the best deal obtainable. It signaled from the start of the talks that it regarded the military option (supposedly always "on the table") as in fact unthinkable. It collared Congress to prevent imposition of new sanctions when the Iranians acted balky. It was a mistake too to send the secretary of state to head the delegation, especially a secretary of state who had been a presidential nominee: Secretary Kerry was too big to be allowed to fail. His Iranian counterpart, by contrast, could easily be disavowed by a regime whose supreme authority always maintained a wide distance from the talks.
Nor is the administration enacting its agreement as if it felt confident of its merits. The administration invented an approval process that marginalizes Congress. The agreement becomes binding so long as just one-third of the members of either House support it. For an administration that has complained so much about the anti-democratic filibuster, that's quite a bold departure from the normal constitutional rule.

As they do so, they must contend with critics who are already attacking the agreement that Secretary of State John Kerry and his team have delivered. In particular, members of Congress should be prepared for five familiar claims that have been argued vigorously in opposing previous arms-control agreements. Each sounds right. But if lawmakers review the record, they will find that history has proved each wrong. In one-liners, these arguments assert that "the U.S. cannot possibly reach an advantageous deal with Iran ..."
Claim #1: "Because negotiated agreements undercut America's ability to use force." America's history of negotiations and agreements over weapons of mass destruction with enemy powers since the end of World War II makes clear that deals to constrain nuclear weapons are not an alternative to military, economic, political, and covert instruments in geopolitical competition. Instead, they are one strand of a coherent, comprehensive strategy for protecting and advancing American national interests.
Ultimately, a negotiated agreement with Iran does not limit America's ability to use force if Iran breaks the agreement-or after the agreement expires. Moreover, it does not reduce the effectiveness of such a military option.
Why the Iran Deal Makes Obama's Critics So AngryThis is not my conclusion only. It is the judgment of the individual who arguably knows the most about using military force to prevent states from acquiring nuclear weapons. As a young soldier in the Israeli Air Force, Amos Yadlin was one of the pilots who dropped the bombs that destroyed Iraq's Osirak reactor in 1981. As Israel's head of military intelligence, he designed the attack that destroyed Syria's nuclear plant and developed capabilities and plans for attacking Iran's nuclear program. Assessing the parameters of the framework agreement that Iran and world powers struck in April, Yadlin wrote, "[M]ilitary action against the Iranian nuclear program in 2025 would in all probability not be much more complicated or difficult than in 2015. ... [T]he Iranian program will be reduced compared to what it is today, intelligence about it will be better, and it will be less immune than it is at present."
Much ink has already been spilled over the implications of a nuclear deal with Iran for that country's assertive regional behavior. Arab states and Israel warn of Iranian hegemony and demand assertive American engagement to "push back." But the one place where they are most interested in seeing stepped-up American engagement is the one place where President Obama is least likely to indulge them - Syria. And, fearful of Iran and American withdrawal, Arab states are increasingly dug in against doing the two things that, more than any other, could help gird the Middle East against greater Iranian influence - resolving the Arab world's bitter civil wars and strengthening the resilience of Arab societies. As a result, I don't expect that this nuclear agreement will make much difference, one way or the other, in the chaotic and increasingly violent regional picture.
In  his remarks this morning, President Obama himself hastened to say that his support of the deal "doesn't mean that this deal will resolve all of our differences with Iran. We share the concerns expressed by many of our friends in the Middle East, including Israel and the Gulf States, about Iran's support for terrorism and its use of proxies to destabilize the region."
Iran's regional troublemaking is likely to worsen, regardless of a deal
Iran's proclivity for regional meddling is longstanding, and the chaotic politics of the Arab world since 2011 has given the Islamic Republic unprecedented opportunities to insert itself into local politics in destabilizing ways. In my recent  congressional testimony, and in  remarks to the Herzliya Conference in Israel last month, I explained my view that Iran's regional troublemaking is likely to grow worse in coming years, regardless of a deal over the nuclear program. I said:
In fact, whether there's a nuclear deal or not, I predict we will see a more aggressive approach by Iran in a host of arenas around the region, where the upheaval has given them greater opportunities than before.
If there is a nuclear deal, the hardline elements within the Iranian regime, those most opposed to a deal, are also those with the greatest interest and investment in regional troublemaking. They are likely to use their ability to make noise regionally to try and compensate for the power disadvantages they see inherent in a deal - and they are likely to have a green light from the Supreme Leader to do so, because he will want to compensate them for their unhappiness with a deal.
If there's no deal on the nuclear issue, however, then the Iranian leadership will want to scale up its regional assertions of power for a different reason: in order to solidify or even strengthen its current regional power position in advance of whatever tougher American / Israeli / Sunni Arab efforts it anticipates to contain it.
I stand by that prediction. While sanctions relief will give Iran considerably more resources, it has never lacked motivation for its assertions of power, and it continues to face ample opportunity. As my Herzliya panel partner, Meir Javandefar, revealed at the conference, Iran's sanctions-induced economic hardship in recent years has not prevented Iran from spending billions of dollars and its own soldiers' lives keeping Bashar al-Assad in power. So yes, Iranian meddling across the region will get worse in the wake of an Iran deal - but it was going to get worse anyway.
The real question about Iran's regional behavior is not, therefore, whether a nuclear deal is too dangerous for the Middle East because it will give Iran more ability to make trouble. Trouble, in case you haven't noticed, is not lacking in the Middle East, and Iran is one major source (though not, to be sure, the only one). The real question is what the United States and America's Arab allies are prepared to do about it. Note that, in my view, America's Arab allies have an essential role to play here, independent of the United States. Read on to see what I mean. The regional competition with Iran remains the highest priority for Arab states
My trip to Israel and the Gulf last month made clear that the broader regional power struggle with Iran remains the single most important consideration for Arab governments - not ISIS and other extremist terrorism, not the civil wars erasing state borders, and not domestic instability. But I was struck by how unidimensional my Arab interlocutors' thinking is today about an Iranian-Arab power struggle that's gone on as long as most of them have been alive. As they see it now, Iran is the source of all instability in today's Middle East: of sectarianism, civil conflict, domestic dissent. And Iran's success rises or falls on the scope of American assertions of power in the Middle East; thus, the US withdrawal of forces from Iraq was a signal error that ceded that, one Emirati said, was like "turning the security of the Gulf over to Iran."
It is amazing to realize the extent to which two decades of American military engagement in the Middle East have so thoroughly reshaped Arab expectations, such that they now cannot imagine living safely across the Gulf from Iran unless the region is bristling with American troops. And yet, this is their considered view. And in the absence of the American interventions they seek, they are acting on their own. As I told Congress this spring:
Our Sunni allies are already upping their efforts in countering Iran regionally, as the Yemen operation and the renewed investment in the Syrian rebels demonstrates. Iran will have both the means and the incentive to respond in kind. This is a recipe for an escalatory spiral, perhaps most particularly in Syria and Iraq.
What this means is that, no matter how much the US government asserts its primary regional interest in combating ISIS and Al Qaeda, our major regional partners will remain resolutely focused on the Iranian threat as their primary concern. And it means that, in reassuring and bolstering its partners as part of any Iranian nuclear deal, the United States cannot limit itself to the nuclear issue, or to traditional defense and deterrence.
No matter what equipment or systems the United States is willing to sell to its Arab partners, no matter what aid it is willing to provide, no matter what US assets the administration is prepared to base in the region - our partners are looking for a different kind of reassurance. They are looking to see the United States demonstrate its recognition of Iran's troublesome activities around the region, and demonstrate its readiness to push back against Iran's expansionism around the region. And the primary arena in which the Arab states wish to see that from the United States is in Syria.
Of course, American reticence in Syria is quite clear, consistent, and supported by a wide array of the American political spectrum. The Syrian arena is the one where the current US president is least likely to undertake any more assertive action to counter Iran - though he is increasingly willing to invest American power in countering ISIS there. So if they are counting on American intervention in Syria to push back Iran, the Arab partners are likely to be disappointed. 
A nuclear deal does not leave America's regional allies helpless against Iran
And yet, America's regional allies should not therefore conclude that the Iranian nuclear deal leaves them helpless against a looming onslaught of well-funded subversion and insurgency. Even if the benefits to Iran from sanctions relief amount to the estimated $100 billion, sanctions relief will take months even to begin, and will take far longer to fully play out. That $100 billion will not flow to Iranian coffers overnight - and that means that the United States and its Arab partners have a window of opportunity to work together now to bolster their efforts to contain Iranian efforts and strengthen Arab societies against Iranian meddling.
The measures the White House rolled out after the US-GCC Camp David summit are an important, but insufficient, dimension of this approach - ballistic missile defense measures, joint exercises, border security support and cooperation on cybersecurity will all help to demonstrate resolve, and thus to deter any escalation by Iran of its efforts at troublemaking in the Gulf. But more can be done, and not by Washington alone.
My house was robbed some years ago, one winter night when I went out and left the back door unlocked. The robbers are guilty to be sure - for their bad intentions, and for stealing my stuff. Maybe they would have broken a window to get in even if I had locked the door. But although they are thoroughly bad apples, I can't avoid my own responsibility for making it so easy for them carry out their nefarious plans. Now I have an alarm system and new locks - that I use diligently.
Similarly, it's difficult but necessary for Arab leaders to acknowledge that their and their colleagues' failings helped generate the expanded opportunities Iran has found for troublemaking since 2011, and their actions now can shape Iran's scope for troublemaking in the future. The failed governance, corruption, repression and abuses that produced the Arab uprisings, and the brutal responses of some Arab leaders to those uprisings, sparked civil conflict in Syria, Libya, and Yemen and ongoing crisis in Bahrain - fracturing societies and opening wide new windows for Iranian influence. The sectarian rhetoric Arab leaders used to rally their publics against Bashar al-Assad at the outset of the Syrian civil war likewise stoked resentments and rifts against the Shia within their own societies. 
Arab governments can turn the tide of regional chaos
Iran and (more recently, as bombings in Qatif and Kuwait show) ISIS are the beneficiaries of these domestic divisions. No doubt Iran was looking for such opportunities, and was eager to exploit them. But instead of continuing to leave their doors unlocked, the Arab governments still standing in this chaotic region can do two things right now to try and turn the tide - and in the process, enhance the prospects for more active American engagement in the region down the line. 
First, they need to move urgently to push the Arab world's civil wars toward resolution. The fractious parties in Yemen, Syria, and Libya are not easy to work with; but Arab leaders can ensure that their engagement supports diplomacy and negotiated peace, rather than exacerbating divisions among factions and prolonging the fighting. Reportedly, this was one agreed-upon agenda item at Camp David - but the follow up has been slow.
Second, Arab governments should urgently do what they can to strengthen the resilience of their own societies and their resistance to Iranian efforts at penetration, subversion and manipulation. The best way to do that is to act now to tamp down the rampant sectarianism of the past few years and to replace it with positive efforts at a more pluralistic and inclusive model of citizenship and government. 
While individual clerics and Sunni movements may have their concerns and preferences regarding "deviant" forms of Islam, the state must be resolutely neutral in embracing all its citizens equally, and must not just abjure, but oppose, efforts by those movements to define any of their fellow citizens as illegitimate foreigners. 
Measures to ensure tolerance and protection for religious and ethnic minorities within the Arab world will not only harden these societies against Iranian subversion - they will also marginalize extremist voices on the Sunni side who recruit for ISIS and its ilk, and they will strengthen the determination of these societies to resist the action-reaction cycle of violence that extremists of all kinds try to produce to further their own ends.
President Obama angered Arab governments by noting before the GCC summit at Camp David that their greatest security threat may not come from external aggression, but from within their own societies. Observing the nature of Iranian behavior in the Middle East, those two threats may be two sides of the same coin. And if Arab leaders fear the consequences of sanctions relief for Iranian action, they could seize the chance now to strengthen their own foundations and gird their societies against what is likely to come.
I've resisted the urge to comment much on the Iran negotiations, in part because I  wanted to support a deal and, now that it's been struck, I do - but with major reservations. I can't help feeling that we've paid a tremendous cost for what can only be described as a narrow - if understandable - focus on the minutia of Iran's nuclear program, including extremely technical questions about, for example, centrifuges. I've found it hard to relate to this sort of discussion, because I've never quite seen Iran's nuclear capability as  the  issue. Iran's nuclear program mattered of course, but it mattered more because of the kind of regional actor Iran happened to be (if Iran was a U.S. ally and a democracy, we'd be having a different conversation). Our Gulf allies, for all their faults, recognized this. For them, this - Iran's destabilizing role in the region - was what worried them most. And while they exaggerated Iran's meddling, while conveniently eliding their own, they were right to view Iran as a fundamentally negative force in places like Syria and Lebanon.
The Obama administration underscored time and time again that this wasn't about Iran's other activities in the region: it was about the nuclear program. This, I gathered, was  intended to reassure, but its effect was the opposite. Sure, any Iran deal depended on "dissociating" the nuclear issue from everything else, but the problem was that everything else mattered a whole lot, and perhaps just as much. To the extent that a successful deal - and keeping the Europeans on board - depended on "siloing," the drawbacks of a deal were built in to the process. These starting assumptions did not start with President Obama, but  with Bush, a fact all too often ignored. 
Administrations can, of course, "walk and chew gum at the same time," but that neglects the interrelated nature of Middle East conflicts. The boutique case-by-base approach to the region that Obama has championed sounds smart and nuanced in theory - a welcome respite Bush's self-consciously grandiose frameworks - but if the Arab Spring underscored anything, it's that politics are rarely only local. In nearly every major crisis and conflict - whether in Syria, Iraq, Yemen, Libya, Egypt, Lebanon, or Bahrain - external actors with regional ambitions  have played an outsized, even decisive role.
It's difficult to believe in the durability of Egyptian authoritarianism without understanding Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates' view of the Muslim Brotherhood as a transnational and not just a local threat. In Iraq, Iran seems like a potential (or actual) partner in the war on ISIS, until you realize that Iran is the determined patron of the Syrian regime, whose brutality has fueled ISIS' rise to prominence. Meanwhile, the Obama administration's  "Iraq-first" strategy against ISIS seems reasonable, until you realize our opponents treat Iraq and Syria as a combined theater, and that the fact that we don't puts us at a profound disadvantage. In short, thinking that we can "silo" the Iranian nuclear issue, or even Iran, suggests a detachment from the region's realities as they're actually lived. 
It is fairly easy (at least for most people) to actually walk and chew gum at the same time. Doing one doesn't affect the other, which makes it an inapt metaphor for policymaking. The Obama administration's decision to focus on Iran's nuclear program and, to a lesser extent, the Israeli-Palestinian conflict meant that we could, and would, do less of other things, and do them less well. Political capital and bandwidth are finite resources. Policymaking is about to deciding what to prioritize, particularly when the president and a small coterie of close advisors are pulled in seemingly endless number of competing directions.
When it comes to allies - especially ones that become nervous rather quickly and act rashly when nervous - you can afford to alienate them, but only up to a point. So you pick your battles. We wanted the Saudis to limit their public criticism of the Iran talks and to go along with them, however grudgingly. We knew this was asking a lot, which made it difficult to make other big asks, on, say, putting pressure on the Sissi regime in Egypt to be even just a tiny bit less repressive. But it is perhaps in Yemen where the most damage has been done. (And this isn't just about the civil war. From 2011 onwards, we outsourced our Yemen policy to Saudi Arabia. To correct this, we  outsourced our Yemen policy to Saudi Arabia).
It's no secret that our Gulf allies feel that we haven't done nearly enough to counter Iran's ambitions in the region. The fact that Obama seems to  hold out hope that a deal could help rehabilitate Iran both regionally and internationally doesn't help matters. But, putting that aside, we do know that Saudi Arabia and other Gulf countries opted to launch a destructive intervention in Yemen, at tremendous  human cost, in part because of fears of U.S. disengagement and nervousness over U.S. policy toward Iran. As Ken Pollack  recently testified to Congress: "In private, GCC officials make no bones in saying that they felt compelled to [intervene in Yemen] because the United States was embracing Iran rather than deterring or defeating it." American officials, despite having major qualms about the intervention, had little interest in picking a fight with Saudi Arabia over Yemen, when they were already expending their political capital to reassure the Saudis about the Iran negotiations.   
Then there's Syria. It was clear from the start of the uprising that Obama did, in fact, have a clear objective - minimizing U.S. involvement as much as possible. But there are other places, such as Iraq, where the Obama administration was pulled back in despite (or, more likely, because of) its best efforts. The unwillingness to rethink Syria strategy in any serious way has been reinforced by the momentum of Iran negotiations. Why rock the boat and potentially provoke a major international incident, when progress was being made on Iran's nuclear program? Why even take the chance with so much at stake? "Linkage," moreover, was been built in to the policy process. As the journalist Josh Rogin  noted: "All Syria proposals at State must go through the office of the undersecretary for political affairs, Wendy Sherman, who is also the administration's lead negotiator over a nuclear deal with Iran."
On the specifics of a deal, I tend to think, like many, that the U.S. made too many concessions, without getting enough in return. According to the  New York Times, in the final days of talks, a television anchor on a hardline Iranian channel  said: "The fact is, Obama needs this deal much more than we do." She went on: "The American president needs a victory, and only a deal with Iran can give him that. They have retreated on several issues and compromised on their own red lines." Whether or not this perception is fair, it's a perception nonetheless, and perceptions drive behavior.
Others have noted that Iran, due to its deteriorating economy,  needed a deal more than the U.S. did. This is almost certainly true. But while Iran may have needed it more, the U.S. wanted it more - or, at the very least, seemed like it did. Some of this, to be fair, was outside the U.S.'s control. The perception had already solidified throughout the region, drawing on 6 years of observing the Obama administration's handling of various crises, most notably the backing down from stated "red lines" in Syria. Allies, such as Egypt, and enemies, such as Syria, have grown confident that we'll blink first in a staring contest, in part because we usually do. This was why I was skeptical that any final deal could ever be the best possible deal. The administration has had tendency to misuse and/or  underestimate its leverage in some of our most important bilateral relationships. As the negotiations wrapped to a close, there was no obvious way to address this. It was too late. We couldn't change how Iran viewed the Obama administration.
There was a related asymmetry during the negotiations. As Pollack  notes, "I don't think that Iran values a nuclear deal as much as it does its positions in these various countries." With us, it was the reverse: we cared less about Iran's positions in various countries and more about its nuclear program. This, too, was built in to the talks.
Some  are troubled that most people had strong opinions about the deal before reading the actual text of the agreement. One certainly hopes that legislators will  eventually read at least some of it. But the specifics of the deal aren't, ultimately, as important as the broader issues and implications, and those aren't anywhere to be found in the text. Here, I tend to agree with my colleague Jeremy Shapiro who  argued in April that that the devil  wasn't in the details. The details "really don't matter." He goes on: "At heart, this is a fight over what to do about Iran's challenge to U.S. leadership in the Middle East and the threat that Iranian geopolitical ambitions pose to U.S. allies."
In other words, your position on the Iran deal is likely to depend on how you view the Middle East and America's role in it more broadly. If you see the Syrian civil war as a, or even  the, core regional conflict, then you're probably worried about the $100 billion in potential sanctions relief. Iran, even we assume it chooses  butter over guns as American officials hope and uses, say, only 3 percent of that total, will have $3 billion more to prop up the Syrian regime and other regional allies and proxies. It also depends on your starting assumptions about the nature of the Iranian regime. Are Iranian leaders "rational," and do you think it matters whether "moderates," such as President Rouhani and Foreign Minister Zarif, are empowered over their "hardline" counterparts?
For me, at least one other issue comes into play, and it's a factor which has pushed me to be more supportive of the Iran deal than I expected to be. It's striking how little discussion there has been about what  Iranians think and want. As small-d democrats, Americans should always at least take into account public opinion in other countries. Presumably, Iranians know their country better than American politicians do. According to  opinion polls, a majority of Iranians favor a deal. We all saw the pictures of ordinary Iranians celebrating the framework agreement in April. This time around, the regime has been more careful, closing off public spaces, with hardliners  warning of the dangers of Iran Deal-induced "happiness." Importantly, as Nader Hashemi  notes, "some of the most vociferous defenders of a nuclear deal with the West are Iranian civil society and human rights activists." It makes little sense for us to say that an Iran deal will make progress on human rights  less likely, when Iran's own human rights activists seem to think the opposite. In a survey of  22 leading human rights activists, support for ongoing negotiations was "unanimous," while over half believed that a deal would lead to a significant improvement on human rights in Iran. Of course, they could be wrong, but we shouldn't bet on that.
To be sure, the link between a deal and the empowerment of Iranian reformers as intuitive as it might seem, is far from guaranteed. As  many have noted, conservatives may be just as likely to gain from a deal for any number of reasons. What seems inescapable, however, is that the failure of negotiations would have been a major, perhaps even decisive loss for Iran's reformist trend. President Hassan Rouhani, who buoyed expectations with his come-from-behind election victory two years ago, has been  losing popularity and goodwill. On human rights, he pledged to expand personal freedoms and broaden space for civil society. As for the economy, it can sputter along, as it has, but without sanctions relief, Rouhani's hands are tied. His raison d'etre, then, depends on a successful deal. Without one, we would have likely had more of the same: conservatives in control and dominating the country's politics. Now at the least there is a glimmer of possibility, even if the road toward substantive reforms remains a difficult one. 
Taking these various, and very different, factors into account, the deal is, on balance, a mixed bag. I don't think an Iran nuclear deal deserved the near-obsessive focus it received from this administration. Too much was subsumed and compromised due to the desire for a deal, an administration priority which took precedence over nearly everything else. Now that a deal has been concluded, U.S. officials may have more room to maneuver. Of course, the implementation of a deal will still require constant attention, to say nothing of the domestic fight which is still to come. But perhaps, at some point, the U.S. will be able to act and think beyond Iran's nuclear program and re-focus attention on the broader issues and conflicts in which Iran plays a major role. The U.S. will now come under pressure to "compensate" (or overcompensate depending on your perspective). It will need to reassure skeptical Gulf allies that it will do more to counter Iran's regional designs. I agree with Ken Pollack that the best place to do this is probably in Syria. As he  writes: "In the aftermath of an Iranian nuclear deal, finally executing the Administration's proclaimed strategy for Syria, may be the best and only way to regain control over the dangerous confrontation escalating between Iran and America's Arab allies."
Now that President Obama's legacy, however controversial, is secure (both on domestic and foreign policy), he can now afford to do the very things he wasn't willing to do when Iran negotiations were the overwhelming focus. That doesn't mean he will do them, but that's where, I hope, the debate over a post-Iran deal Middle East can now turn.

"Look, 20 years from now, I'm still going to be around, God willing. If Iran has a nuclear weapon, it's my name on this." - President Barack Obama, May 21, 2015 The theocratic regime that rules Iran-a regime that is a committed and proficient sponsor of terrorism, according to John Kerry's State Department-will be more powerful tomorrow than it is today, thanks to the agreement it has just negotiated with the Obama administration, America's European allies, and two U.S. adversaries as well.
This sad conclusion is unavoidable. The lifting of crippling sanctions, which will come about as part of the nuclear deal struck in Vienna, means that at least $150 billion, a sum Barack Obama first invoked in May, will soon enough flow to Tehran. With this very large pot of money, the regime will be able to fund both domestic works and foreign adventures in Syria, Yemen, Lebanon, Iraq, and elsewhere.
It is hard to imagine a scenario-at least in the short term-in which Hezbollah and other terror organizations on the Iranian payroll don't see a windfall from the agreement. This is a bad development in particular for the people of Syria. Iran, as the Assad regime's funder, protector, and supplier of weapons, foot soldiers, and strategists, is playing a crucial role in the destruction of Syria. Now Syrians will see their oppressor become wealthier and gain international legitimacy (legitimacy not just for Iran's nuclear infrastructure, which this deal will leave in place). Here is a bit of what the State Department says about Iran's role in what might be the world's most awful war: "In 2014, Iran continued to provide arms, financing, training, and the facilitation of primarily Iraqi Shia and Afghan fighters to support the Asad regime's brutal crackdown that has resulted in the deaths of at least 191,000 people in Syria."
'Look ... It's My Name on This': Obama Defends the Iran Nuclear DealAnd yet the deal, though representing a morally dubious compromise with a terror-supporting theocracy, might be, from the perspective of U.S. national security, a practical necessity. I'm writing this just as the deal is being announced, and I think it is dangerous to make sweeping judgments about a complicated document I've only skimmed. (And, of course, there will be plenty of time in Washington over the next 60 days for sweeping judgments!) But here is the most important question to ask going forward: Does this deal significantly reduce the chance that Iran could, in the foreseeable future (20 years is the time period Obama mentioned in an interview with me in May), continue its nefarious activities under the protection of a nuclear umbrella? If the answer to this question is yes, then a deal, in theory, is worth supporting.
I have no doubt that this deal isn't perfect. I'm worried, in particular, about the issue of intrusive inspections: How much visibility will the International Atomic Energy Agency (and, by the way, the CIA and other Western intelligence agencies) have into the Iranian nuclear program? How quickly will inspectors be able to visit sites they want to visit?  I'm also worried about the time-based, rather than condition-based, lifting of arms embargoes (the United States should never acquiesce to a flow of arms to a terror-sponsoring state), and about Iran's ability to continue its research and development on ballistic missiles and other aspects of a nuclear program. I also believe that so-called "snapback" sanctions are a fiction: The U.S. could reimpose sanctions on Iran if Tehran cheats on the deal, but it would be reimposing these sanctions on what will be a much-richer country, one that could withstand such sanctions for quite a while.
Snapback is actually a person, not a mechanism. The 45th president of the United States will be America's snapback. The Iranians will not find the next president to be as accommodating as the current president (unless, of course, Rand Paul wins the general election). All of today's frontrunners-Marco Rubio, Jeb Bush, Scott Walker, and Hillary Clinton-would, as president, be watching Iranian behavior with jaundiced eyes. I don't doubt that Hillary Clinton will support the current deal, but I also don't doubt that she would push back hard against Iranian cheating, or Iranian adventurism, if she becomes president. ("I've always been in the camp that held that they did not have a right to enrichment," she told me last year. "Contrary to their claim, there is no such thing as a right to enrich. This is absolutely unfounded.")
The Iran drama is only beginning. Assuming that Obama can sell this deal to Congress-Chuck Schumer, a nation turns its lonely eyes to you-this will be a multi-year story of implementation. I wish I could believe what Obama seems to suspect, that this deal will set in motion a virtuous cycle in which moderates (relative moderates, of course) gain power in a liberalizing Iran. But I don't think that this is happening soon. For now, I hope that Obama will study the reality of Iranian activity in the region, and begin to push back against Iran's ambitions with more alacrity than he has done so far.
The nuclear accord reached with Iran on July 14 puts welcome limits on Iran's uranium enrichment capabilities but does not go far enough to restrain its capabilities, says CFR President Richard N. Haass. "It is essential that people focus just as much on the challenges of the scenario in which Iran complies with the agreement as the scenario in which Iran fails to comply," Haass says. "I am more worried about the long-term consequences of Iranian compliance than I am about the short-term consequences of Iranian cheating."

What is your impression of the agreement signed today by the United States, UK, France, Russia, China, and Germany and Iran?  Like any other negotiated agreement there are things in it that are attractive and things in it that give one pause. On the attractive side are obviously the limits on the quality and quantity of centrifuges and the significant limits on the quality and quantity of enriched uranium that Iran is allowed to keep. There seem to be arrangements for inspections. It's not quite clear whether there's a difference between "where and when necessary,"as the president phrased it, and "anytime, anywhere," but this is to be determined. But all in all, what the agreement appears to do is provide fifteen years in which Iran does not have nuclear weapons.
"Everyone should be careful about predicting or assuming in any way that this will lead to a moderating of Iran's behavior towards its own citizens or toward its neighbors."
On the downside is that significant financial resources will begin to flow to Iran which they can use for any and all purposes. There is the lifting after five years of an arms embargo and after eight years of a missile embargo. Iran is allowed to keep a lot of nuclear-related capacity, so this is a far cry from what the UN and others initially said they wanted. There is the possibility of noncompliance. But to me the biggest question mark and the biggest concern I have with the agreement is perhaps, ironically, not the possibility that Iran may not comply, it's my concern over what happens if Iran does comply.
You don't think over the next ten years or so we can woo Iran into our Western bosom?  I had assumed that there is such a build up of interest amongWhat about the United States' relations with Israel and with its Arab friends in the region?   the Iranian middle class that this Could you comment on a seemingly de facto alliance between Saudi Arabia and Israel? How do you think Obama handled this whole negotiation?  would lead to a warming with I gather from your comments that you  regard this as a lackluster agreement?  the United States, and that once the current ayatollah passed from the scene that there would be a new opening in Iran.  My concern is that Iran can start prepositioning centrifuges after ten years and, after  fifteen years, enriched uranium. It could then prepare for a breakout. There is nothing in the agreement that says what Iran cannot do in ten years on centrifuges and fifteen years on enriched uranium. It simply says that the additional protocol and the nonproliferation treaty will pertain. But there are no ceilings on capability. So the real concern I have is less the strategic significance of Iranian noncompliance than the strategic significance of Iranian compliance.
There's clearly a hope or belief on the part of many in the administration, apparently reinforced by the Iranian foreign minister, that this agreement has the potential to do just that. To use [former U.S. diplomat] George Kennan's term, some believe this agreement has the potential to lead to a "mellowing" of Iran. I call that wishful thinking. I can't rule it out, I hope it's true. But I for one don't see it. If anything the flow of resources will work in the opposite direction. Iran believes it's on something of a strategic roll. So I doubt that will happen. But in any event since we can't know, I would simply say it would be a mistake to in any way defend this agreement on the basis that it will lead to a change in Iran's character or behavior. At no point over the duration of this agreement ought we cut Iran any slack on the details of the agreement, which affects capabilities, in the hope that somehow its intentions evolve. That would be a real mistake.
I can't say you're wrong. And I hope you're right. But we do have the likely succession at the ayatollah level. You have political succession in the course of this agreement. You have the powerful interest groups in Iran: clerics, the Revolutionary Guard, bazaaris, and others. You have class divisions in Iran as we saw in the so-called June [2009] revolution. So I would again think yes, it is quite possible that some elements of Iranian society in the Iranian political space will try to run with this agreement and to reintegrate Iran with the world. And I expect others will push back. I don't think we can be confident that we know how this will play out. It is even possible in the short run that many in Iran's leadership will need to do radical things simply to demonstrate that they haven't somehow sold out the revolution by signing this agreement with the "Great Satan." So everyone should be careful about predicting or assuming in any way that this will lead to a moderating of Iran's behavior towards its own citizens or toward its neighbors.
This agreement complicates U.S. relations both with Israel and Iran's neighbors. Even without this agreement, rebuilding trust and confidence with Israel would be a priority. It may be impossible with this president, given his relationship with this particular prime minister of Israel [Benjamin Netanyahu]. This might be something better left to [Obama's] successor, Republican or Democrat. But you need to reestablish strategic trust with Israel. Because it is quite possible that at various moments during this agreement there will be either real questions about Iranian behavior or simply some very tough issues in the region: the future of Jordan, stability of Syria. These are the kinds of issues that require very close U.S.-Israeli cooperation. Just as tough is going to be relations with the Sunni Arab governments who, from what I can tell, at least in the case of Saudi Arabia, seem to be more concerned with Iran than with ISIS.
I don't necessarily share that strategic view. More broadly, discouraging several of the Arab regimes as well as Turkey from what we might call "hedging" against the Iranian nuclear program with nuclear programs of their own has got to become an American strategic priority. As bad as the Middle East is today, one can imagine a situation that is even worse: A Middle East that has multiple fingers on multiple nuclear weapons would be just that.
My own view is that it is more de facto than a real alliance. I think it's overdrawn. I'm tempted to cite the cliché, "the enemy of your enemy can still be your enemy." Just because the Israelis and Saudis share some concerns about Iran, it is a bit of a reach that there is necessarily a major strategic overlap between the two countries.
I have a mixed reaction. I've negotiated a lot myself. So any time you are willing to sustain a difficult negotiation, that shows a lot of staying power and commitment, it is a plus. On the other hand, I'm concerned that in too many areas we compromised more than we should have. I would have earlier on established some positions and gotten the Europeans to sign onto them so they weren't unilateral American  positions. For instance,  the duration of this agreement. I still don't understand why we were content with a ten-year limit on centrifuges and a fifteen-year limit on enriched uranium when the Non-Proliferation Treaty is open ended. I would have said either open-ended constraints on the Iranian nuclear program or at least far longer duration constraints. And if the Iranians said no and the United States and Europe were together on that, then we would have been prepared not to have this agreement. So that's one area. I don't understand the relaxation of the arms embargo after five years or the missile embargo after eight. It just seems to me that a desire on our part to avoid either a totally unconstrained Iran or a war propelled us to go further than we should have on some of the compromises. There were too many areas where we seemed to split the difference rather than insist on something closer to our position.
It's imperfect. It doesn't solve the problem of Iran's nuclear ambitions. At best it buys us fifteen years. It doesn't solve the problem in any way of Iran's regional reach. If anything it may exacerbate that because of the resources that will now flow to Iran, financial as well as physical. And it may complicate U.S. relations with Iran's neighbors. So my own view is that this will lead to an Iran that is more capable in some ways than the current one. It certainly suggests to me that we are going to be living with the reality of Iran as a regional power for decades to come. I should add it doesn't preclude selective cooperation with Iran. For all I know we could cooperate with Iran in Afghanistan or Iraq or even Syria one day. But  it is important to view the agreement, to judge the agreement, on its merits and not to in any way assume it will lead to a broader relationship with Tehran.
If I could come back to one point: it is essential that people focus just as much on the challenges of the scenario in which Iran complies with the agreement as the scenario in which Iran fails to comply. And I am much more worried about the former. That will pose the greatest strategic challenge. To put it bluntly, I am more worried about the long-term consequences of Iranian compliance than I am about the short-term consequences of Iranian cheating.
It is important to look at this very practically. We are now going from the world of negotiations to the world of politics, now on to congressional consideration. It's safe to predict that both sides will now not just make their cases but overstate their cases. 
IT WAS historic: everyone can agree on that. But whereas some say the deal done in Vienna this week between Iran and six world powers plus the European Union was a breakthrough that keeps nuclear proliferation at bay and begins to mend a 36-year feud with America, others are convinced it was, as Israel's prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, says, a "stunning historic mistake" that sets up Iran as a nuclear power and finances its aggression abroad. Which of those is closer to the truth depends on two things: the quality of the agreement and its effect on Iran's behaviour.
With Iran, backers as well as critics-especially in America's Congress, which now has 60 days to scrutinise the deal-both tend to lapse into magical thinking. The critics argue that, if only the world tried hard enough, Iran would give up the guts of its nuclear programme. But the regime sees mastery of the nuclear-fuel cycle as both a badge of national power and insurance against American military attack, so the critics risk holding out for a bargain that never comes. Backers play down the Iranian regime's antagonism towards America and Israel, its determination to exert influence abroad and its willingness to use violence. They place too much reliance on a transformation of the Iranian regime that may never come about.
With or without an agreement, the world is stuck with an Iran that continues to run a big nuclear programme and remains slippery and dangerous. The real test of the deal is whether it is better than the alternatives. It is.
The critics are right that the agreement legitimises Iran as a threshold nuclear state. If it keeps its word and avoids further restrictions on its programme, Iran will have the know-how and eventually the capacity to arm itself. Yet it will also face greater restraints than it does today (see article). Iran's ability to enrich uranium, the fuel for a bomb, and to develop a weapon will be severely constrained for somewhere between ten and 15 years. After that, it will be subject to the full force of the international treaty against proliferation. The government has agreed to intrusive monitoring of all its nuclear facilities and to inspections on request of its military sites, under a system of "managed access". Sanctions, which are to be lifted as a result of the agreement, can be reimposed if Iran violates it.
For those who oppose this deal, the alternatives are to wait for a better one, or to go to war. Some argue that since sanctions won concessions, more sanctions will win more concessions. Yet if America walked away now, China, Russia and the EU would lose faith in the process and sanctions would crumble instead. Moreover, to think that Iran would surrender the heart of its programme is a reckless gamble. Threatened, it would be more likely to dig in its heels. Iran's nuclear expertise has grown since 2000, and would expand further still in the years before talks were possible once again. Delay could thus end up making an ambitious agreement even harder.
Some critics may believe that attacking Iran is the only option. But war is a poor form of arms-control. Even if America had the stomach for a months-long campaign, and even if it could take out all of Iran's many nuclear sites, bombing cannot destroy nuclear know-how. Instead the programme would go underground, beyond the reach of monitors. An attack would thus be a route to a nuclear-armed Iran. Should Iran dash for the bomb, war might make sense as a last resort, but that option will not disappear just because of this week's agreement.
But the deal brings dangers that its backers are slow to acknowledge. Although the economy is hard-pressed, Iran devotes precious resources to Iraq and Syria; it sponsors Hizbullah, the Lebanese militia-cum-party; and whips up emotions in Bahrain and Yemen. Relieved of sanctions, a richer Iran would surely spend money extending what is mostly a malign influence. Iranian violence abroad may well worsen, as a sop to hardline opponents of the deal in Tehran and as a gesture to show the world that Iran has not gone soft. The perception that the United States is a declining power, which alarms Israel and America's allies in the Gulf, may feed Iranian ambitions.
That is not the whole story, however. The nuclear deal binds Barack Obama, America's president, into the Middle East. This is his foreign-policy legacy and he is its enforcer-in-chief, just as his successors will be. Iran's "empire" is in turmoil-roiled by jihadists (including Islamic State), war with Saudi Arabia in Yemen, and a failing regime in Syria. Extra money will help Iran's efforts, but as America discovered in Iraq, dominance is not determined by resources. If the United States buttresses its oversight of the agreement with sustained regional diplomacy, needed anyway after the Arab spring, then it can help contain Iran.
Although the deal will make Iran more powerful, it will also lead the country to become more open. As in China, the Iranian theocracy rules over a population that long ago lost its revolutionary zeal (see article). The regime agreed to constrain its nuclear programme because, again as in China, it calculated that it is more likely to survive if Iranians feel that they have a shot at prosperity. Unlike North Korea's Kim dynasty, which cheated on its nuclear pact, Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, decided that being a pariah was worse for his regime than rejoining the world.
That choice only makes sense if Iran can now attract trade and investment. The more Iran trades with the rest of the world, the more susceptible it will grow to international pressure. As the country becomes enmeshed in the global economy, interest groups will emerge within Iran's complex, factional politics who will argue that the country's future is better served by decent relations with foreigners than by bad ones. The more Iranians benefit from ties with the outside world, the stronger those moderating voices will become.
A country of Iran's size and sophistication will get a bomb if it really wants one. Nothing can change that. But this pact offers the chance of holding Iran back and shifting its course. The world should embrace it, cautiously.
The nuclear deal was a victory for voices of diplomacy in Iran. It was also a victory for Iran's powerful Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC). The IRGC was never outwardly bullish on a deal, but the criticism of its top commanders (with some exceptions) was held to a low murmur. Some pundits will point to that criticism as evidence that the IRGC was against the deal from the start. But that's incorrect. Because without the support of the IRGC a deal could have never been reached. 
 Now we should ask ourselves why, and what the IRGC's game will be going forward. Sanctions hit the IRGC hard and it is unsurprising to see that the organization stands to have many of the sanctions imposed upon it lifted as part of a deal. Beyond sanctions, a deal also fits with the IRGC's strategic goals. For the IRGC, the nuclear program was first and foremost about establishing a credible deterrent against the United States. The deal essentially takes the option of military action by the United States off the table. With Washington no longer a threat, the IRGC will be free to concentrate its resources on other enemies and strategic concerns, particularly in the region-as even President Obama appeared to acknowledge in his news conference on Wednesday when he said there was a "likelihood" that groups such as Hezbollah would get more Iranian money once it is freed up. 
 That could be a problem inside Iran as well. While Iranian President Hassan Rouhani sees the nuclear agreement as a testament to his government's diplomatic acumen, the IRGC likely sees it as a victory of its policies of resistance to the West. And now new battle lines are opening up inside Iran between reformers and hardliners; whoever wins that internal struggle will determine whether the Islamic Republic emerges from its self-imposed isolation and becomes as a mature member of the international community, or whether it continues to pursue its parochial politics of resistance. 
 If Iran's government represents the power of the pen (the one that signed one of the biggest diplomatic pacts of recent decades), then the IRGC has been its sword. The organization led the campaign of brutality against the pro-democracy demonstrations in 2009 and shattered the associated Green Movement before it could get off the ground. The IRGC saw the protesters as manifestations of American influence and an existential threat to the regime. 
 The IRGC also confronted enemies outside of Iran. It was linked to a string of terrorist attacks in 2011 and 2012, including the failed plot to assassinate the Saudi envoy to the United States, Adel al-Jubeir, in his favorite Washington D.C. restaurant. When a popular uprising began to threaten the Syrian regime of Bashar al-Asad-Iran's closest ally and main conduit to Lebanese Hezbollah-the IRGC moved advisors, arms, equipment, and soldiers to defend Assad from his own people. The IRGC also enlisted Hezbollah, Iraqi militias, and Afghan militants to fight alongside Asad's forces. 
 International condemnation didn't stop the IRGC's aggression, nor did sanctions curb its assertiveness. That is because, to the IRGC, these actions were essential to keep pressure on its enemies. They were an extension of its broader effort of establishing strategic deterrence against outside threats, especially from the United States and Israel. This included the IRGC's development of client armed groups in post-Saddam Iraq (which fought U.S. forces until their withdrawal in 2011) and materiel support for factions of the Taliban in Afghanistan. In other words, the IRGC does not view the nuclear deal to be a triumph of diplomacy alone. Rather, it was the organization's forward-leaning posture against American influence in the region that ultimately compelled the United States to rethink its approach toward Iran. 
 For this reason, the IRGC-like the Iranian people-will have its own high expectations for what should follow a deal. With many of the sanctions removed against it and its commanders, including Qasem Soleimani-who is accused of helping Shiite militias in Iraq kill American soldiers-the IRGC will want to double-down on its activities in the Middle East. More resources, more funding, and more options for procurement, and added legitimacy will help the IRGC both arm itself and support its clients. The organization was already committed to securing its interests in Syria and Iraq, the lifting of nuclear-based sanctions and the opening up of Iran's economy will undoubtedly strengthen the IRGC's ability to do so. 
 The IRGC will also have interests at home. There it will want to preserve the status quo and safeguard its privileged position in domestic power politics. It will not suffer the return of reformism or the politics of change. This instantly puts the IRGC and the regime's broader hardliner constituency at odds with Iran's pro-reform majority. Rouhani's government will have to manage these expectations in order for Iran's stability to continue. 
 Above all, the nuclear issue has been a unifying force in Iranian politics. While there have been vocal critics of the deal, criticism in general has been kept to a low hum by the Supreme Leader, whose unequivocal support for Rouhani's government made the nuclear agreement possible. With a deal out of the way, that unifying force will disappear. In order for Iran to gain strength from the deal, it will need to stay united. Iran is surrounded by instability. The Middle East is crumbling, sectarianism is the new normal, and Iran's Cold War with Saudi Arabia shows no signs of abating. Israel's government has already rejected the deal and will continue to seek ways to undermine Iran's regional influence. With the deal, the Islamic Republic can cross the United States of off its threat list. But what it will soon begin to realize is that the United States was never as big of a threat as the regime's own divisive policies. 
 Reaching the nuclear deal required immense effort and political will on the part the Iranian government, especially Rouhani and Foreign Minister Javad Zarif. In the final push alone, it took dozens of diplomats 18 days and countless bilateral meetings to reach an accord that all participating parties could support. The result: a 159-page nuclear agreement between Iran and the P5+1. Make no mistake: this is an historic achievement. 
 But now the hard part truly begins for Rouhani and his supporters. Many of them see the deal as a crack in the regime's foundational identity of resistance. They hope it will end Iran's alienation and open up their country to the world. They also hope that it will pave the way for greater freedoms at home. Rouhani never promised specifics but reform-minded Iranians expect change to continue. The deal has reaffirmed their belief that change is on the way. Reformists are once again inspired and the expectations of the reform-minded electorate will only continue to grow. 
 But now their real battle will be with the regime's hardliner base. If the opportunities presented by the deal are not seized by Iran's regime, and should the hardliners choose retrenchment over progress and the politics of exclusion over inclusion, then Iran's troubles will only continue. Instead of being a turning point in the history and maturation of the Islamic Republic, the deal will become yet one more missed opportunity and another glaring failure of the revolution.

Iran's nuclear expertise has grown since 2000, and would expand further still in the years before talks were possible once again. Delay could thus end up making an ambitious agreement even harder.
Some critics may believe that attacking Iran is the only option. But war is a poor form of arms-control. Even if America had the stomach for a months-long campaign, and even if it could take out all of Iran's many nuclear sites, bombing cannot destroy nuclear know-how. Instead the programme would go underground, beyond the reach of monitors. An attack would thus be a route to a nuclear-armed Iran. Should Iran dash for the bomb, war might make sense as a last resort, but that option will not disappear just because of this week's agreement.
But the deal brings dangers that its backers are slow to acknowledge. Although the economy is hard-pressed, Iran devotes precious resources to Iraq and Syria; it sponsors Hizbullah, the Lebanese militia-cum-party; and whips up emotions in Bahrain and Yemen. Relieved of sanctions, a richer Iran would surely spend money extending what is mostly a malign influence. Iranian violence abroad may well worsen, as a sop to hardline opponents of the deal in Tehran and as a gesture to show the world that Iran has not gone soft. The perception that the United States is a declining power, which alarms Israel and America's allies in the Gulf, may feed Iranian ambitions.
That is not the whole story, however. The nuclear deal binds Barack Obama, America's president, into the Middle East. This is his foreign-policy legacy and he is its enforcer-in-chief, just as his successors will be. Iran's "empire" is in turmoil-roiled by jihadists (including Islamic State), war with Saudi Arabia in Yemen, and a failing regime in Syria. Extra money will help Iran's efforts, but as America discovered in Iraq, dominance is not determined by resources. If the United States buttresses its oversight of the agreement with sustained regional diplomacy, needed anyway after the Arab spring, then it can help contain Iran.
Although the deal will make Iran more powerful, it will also lead the country to become more open. As in China, the Iranian theocracy rules over a population that long ago lost its revolutionary zeal (see article). The regime agreed to constrain its nuclear programme because, again as in China, it calculated that it is more likely to survive if Iranians feel that they have a shot at prosperity. Unlike North Korea's Kim dynasty, which cheated on its nuclear pact, Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, decided that being a pariah was worse for his regime than rejoining the world.
That choice only makes sense if Iran can now attract trade and investment. The more Iran trades with the rest of the world, the more susceptible it will grow to international pressure. As the country becomes enmeshed in the global economy, interest groups will emerge within Iran's complex, factional politics who will argue that the country's future is better served by decent relations with foreigners than by bad ones. The more Iranians benefit from ties with the outside world, the stronger those moderating voices will become.
A country of Iran's size and sophistication will get a bomb if it really wants one. Nothing can change that. But this pact offers the chance of holding Iran back and shifting its course. The world should embrace it, cautiously.
There's already a lot of commentary out there on the Iranian nuclear deal (officially termed the " Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action " or JCPOA), and there's sure to be lots more coming in the next few days. But what does the deal actually do? You know, what's in that very long and very dense document the parties have agreed to?
Iran and the P5+1 (US, France, Germany, UK, China, Russia and the EU) have been negotiating at breakneck speed, and understandably, making the text clear and user-friendly was not a top-priority for any of the negotiators. Much of it is unclear and duplicative, and a complicated web of intertextual references and citations makes for difficult reading.
Don't worry though: We live to serve. Here's a comprehensive summary.
The document begins with a Preface, which is pretty much what you'd expect, containing very general language about the broad purposes of the JCOPA: to "ensure that Iran's nuclear programme will be exclusively peaceful," and to "produce the comprehensive lifting of all UN Security Council sanctions as well as multilateral and national sanctions related to Iran's nuclear programme."
It next moves on to a Preamble & General Provisions, which provides the principles that the rest of the agreement's text will fill out: The deal will ensure the peaceful nature of the Iranian nuclear program and is to be endorsed by the UN Security Council. This UNSC resolution will provide for termination of all UN sanctions related to the the nuclear issue on "Implementation Day" (the day the IAEA certifies Iranian compliance with a subset of its obligations) and conclusion of UNSC consideration of the Iranian nuclear issue a little over ten years from now (on what the deal calls, with somewhat Schwarzeneggerian overtones, "Termination Day").
Iran reaffirms it will never "seek, develop or acquire any nuclear weapons." In turn, the P5+1 agree that all sanctions related to Iran's nuclear program will be lifted and that they will refrain from imposing discriminatory regulatory and procedural requirements in their place. Although Iran is recognized as having all the standard NPT rights and obligations of a non-nuclear state, the agreement's provisions stipulate that the JCPOA's provision should not be viewed as precedent for interpreting international law, agreements or the NPT.
A "Joint Commission" consisting of eight members--US, UK, France, Germany, China, Russia, Iran and the EU--will be created to monitor implementation and resolve disputes. The P5+1 will also meet with Iran at the ministerial level every two years, or earlier if needed. Additionally, these same powers will cooperate with Iran "in the field of peaceful uses of nuclear energy" and "mutually determined civil nuclear cooperation projects."
The next section, entitled " Nuclear "--together with Annex material that it references--provides the meat of Iran's obligations under the deal.
With respect to " Enrichment, Enrichment R&D, Stockpiles" the section requires that there will be "certain agreed limitations" on uranium enrichment activities and R&D for eight years. Afterward, Iran's enrichment will primarily be bound by voluntary commitments that will be submitted to IAEA as part of its (provisional) implementation of the Additional Protocol (this submission must occur prior to Implementation Day). For 15 years, all testing with uranium and uranium enrichment will occur exclusively in Natanz, and enrichment will only be up to 3.67 percent (enough for civilian use). Iran's total stockpile of enriched uranium will remain under 300 kg of 3.67 percent, and the excess will be sold. The agreement also goes into extensive detail about how and where various sorts of equipment must be stored within Natanz.
For ten years, Iran's (limited) enrichment program will continue exclusively with 5,060 active centrifuges, all of the simplest IR-1 model and all operating in Natanz. If any of these break, Iran may replace them with replacements of the same model. All excess and damaged centrifuges and equipment will be stored under continuous monitoring by the IAEA, also at Natanz. During these ten years, Iran can also continue research and development (R&D) enrichment with existing, more advanced centrifuges, but can only continue testing two of each model. For the bulk of these ten years, Iran will also be largely restricted from creating more centrifuges. After eight and a half years, these restrictions begin to lapse. The number of active advanced centrifuges jumps to thirty, and Iran can start producing more--to be kept incomplete and under IAEA monitoring for the remaining year and a half and eventually brought into operation "as needed."
While all enrichment is taking place at Natanz, Fordow (a formerly secret facility revealed by Western intelligence in 2009) will be converted into a "nuclear, physics and technology centre." International collaboration will be established for joint areas of research, and the Joint Commission will be told in advance of the projects that will be pursued there. The IAEA will designate the amount of uranium that can remain at the plant from past "enrichment operations," and inspectors will have daily access to the plant for 15 years.
Similarly, for 15 years, no uranium enrichment will take place at Fordow and no nuclear material will be present. For the same period, only 1044 IR-1 centrifuges (in six cascades) will remain at Fordow. Two of these cascades will spin without uranium and will be transitioned to stable isotope production. The rest will remain idle. All other infrastructure, particularly connections and pipework that could allow these centrifuges to be used for enrichment of weapons-grade uranium, will be removed and stored under IAEA continuous monitoring at Natanz.
With respect to Arak, Heavy Water, and Fuel Reprocessing Iran commits to redesigning Arak as a modernised heavy water research reactor for industrial and medicinal research. A Working Group of the P5+1 will help with both the redesign and the implementation of the redesign (including technical & financial support, and facilitating the sale and transfer of necessary materials), although Iran will take the lead. The redesigned reactor will not produce weapons grade plutonium "in normal operation" and will minimize production of plutonium altogether. The design must be agreed on by the Joint Commission, and the IAEA will monitor construction.
The redesigned reactor will use specified measurements of uranium, and the fuel design will need to be reviewed and approved by the Joint Commission. Certain existing materials, such as natural uranium pellets and IR-40 fuel assemblies, will be placed under continuous monitoring until they can be converted. All spent fuel, for the lifetime of the reactor, will be shipped out of country. The reactor will operate under IAEA monitoring.
For 15 years, other than Arak, there will be no additional heavy water reactors or accumulation of heavy water, and all excess heavy water (as defined explicitly in the deal) will be made available for export. Iran will report on this to the IAEA, which will have access in order to verify. For the same period, Iran will not acquire do any reprocessing or related activities (except for a very specific few). According to the deal, Iran also "does not intend to thereafter" do so either. The force of this language is unclear; it also seems less strict the Lausanne language that "Iran has committed indefinitely to not conduct reprocessing or reprocessing research and development on spent nuclear fuel."
The next section lays out a series of Transparency and Confidence Building Measures. Over the next few months, Iran will provisionally apply the Additional Protocol (allowing for increased inspections), and fully implement both modified code 3.1 (obligating Iran to disclose new nuclear facilities before construction starts) and the " Roadmap for Clarification of Past and Present Outstanding Issues." The IAEA will have to verify that these (as well as other measures) have been completed in order to trigger "Implementation Day."
In the time frames specified (starting on Adoption Day and continuing for various periods of between 8 year and 25 years), Iran will allow the IAEA to both monitor the implementation of the voluntary measures and to implement transparency measures that include:
containment and surveillance of centrifuge rotors and bellows; and
a reliable mechanism to ensure speedy resolution of IAEA access concerns.
Iran will also "seek" to obtain parliamentary ratification and thus formally conclude the Additional Protocol. (This last action will either occur by, or beginning on, Transition Day. The language is unclear).
For an unspecified duration of time, Iran also agrees not to engage in activities, including at the research and design level, that could contribute to the development of a nuclear explosive device. Such activities include developing or using explosively driven neutron sources, or computer models to simulate nuclear explosive devices. Iran also agrees to cooperate with and act in accordance with the procurement channel specified in the JCPOA (i.e. under the oversight and approval of the Joint Commission) when obtaining certain sensitive nuclear-related material.
Those are Iran's obligations under the agreement. Here's what Iran gets in return. The main benefits involve Sanctions relief. On Implementation Day (i.e. simultaneously with IAEA-verification that Iran has met certain preliminary obligations), the UN Security Council will "lift" all sanctions related to the Iranian nuclear issue (imposed from  from 2006-2015). Similarly, the EU will terminate all of its economic and financial sanctions, and US sanctions waivers and suspensions will take effect. This wave of relief will include suspension of sanctions related to:
financial banking and transactions with Iranian institutions,
After eight years (or when the IAEA reaches the Broader Conclusion, whichever is earlier), the EU will terminate all proliferation-related sanctions and the US. will terminate or modify sanctions preventing Iran's acquiring nuclear-related commodities and services (translation: ballistic missiles). At this time, the US's approach to Iran's nuclear activities must be consistent with the U.S. approach to other non-nuclear-weapon states. The United States must also make every effort to encourage officials at the state or local level to take into account the changes in the U.S. policy and to lift their own sanctions regimes.
Both the United States and the EU will refrain from re-introducing or re-imposing the sanctions that they terminated as a result of the JCPOA. There will also be no new nuclear-related UN Security Council sanctions and no new EU or U.S. sanctions. Presumably, the US and EU could still impose new (even identical) sanctions on Iranian individuals or institutions for reasons unrelated to the nuclear program (e.g. an upsurge in Iranian support for terrorism).
Crucially, however, the agreement also recognizes that "Iran has stated that it will treat such a re-introduction or re-imposition of the sanctions... as grounds to cease performing its commitments under this JCPOA in whole or in part." This seems to acknowledge that as long as Iran complies with the deal, the US and EU will likely be very hesitant to impose new sanctions irrespective of other behavior.
The EU, EU Member States, and US will also issue clear public guidance about the sanctions relief, and will refrain from any policy intended to adversely affect the normalization of trade and economic relations with Iran. They commit to engaging in joint projects with Iran, including through IAEA cooperation projects, in the field of peaceful nuclear technology. These joint projects include: nuclear power plants, research reactors, fuel fabrication, agreed joint advanced R&D such as fusion, establishment of a regional nuclear medical center, personnel training, nuclear safety and security, and environmental protection. Iran and these countries will also agree on steps to ensure Iran's access in areas of trade, technology, finance and energy.
The deal then lays out an Implementation Plan which lists the five "milestones" for implementation of JCPOA commitments:
Finalization Day: The day the agreement is reached, and is endorsed by Iran and the P5+1: July 14, 2015. The deal is submitted to the UNSC and the EU Council, and Iran and the IAEA begin working on transparency arrangements. Participants in the agreement will "make necessary arrangements and preparations" to implement their commitments on "Adoption Day,"
Adoption Day: 90 days after the UNSC votes to endorse the JCPOA, passing resolutions that will, on Implementation Day, lift all nuclear-related sanctions on Iran. (Adoption Day can also come earlier by mutual agreement of the parties.) Iran provisionally applies the Additional Protocol (allowing for increased inspections), fully implements modified code 3.1 (obligating Iran to disclose new nuclear facilities before construction starts), and provides certain information in writing to the IAEA about "outstanding issues." The EU and US President will pass those regulations and issue those waivers necessary to begin sanction relief on Implementation Day. Iran and the P5+1 begin discussions on a document defining their respective roles in the transition of the Arak Heavy Water Reactor.
Implementation Day:  The day the IAEA certifies that Iran has conformed to a specified, significant subset of its obligations--e.g. implementing changes at Arak, capping enrichment capacity, provisionally implementing the Additional Protocol etc. Simultaneous with the IAEA certification, previously issued EU regulations, UN Security Council resolution, and US presidential waivers will take effect, providing Iran with sweeping sanctions relief. Sanctions that expire on Implementation Day include: restrictions on banking, transfers, loans, insurance, US currency, trade, oil, gas, transport, shipping and metals designated individuals and companies, and automobiles.
Transition Day: Either 8 years after Adoption Day, or when the IAEA and UNSC reach the "Broader Conclusion" that Iran's nuclear program is entirely peaceful (whichever is first). Iran will "seek" parliamentary ratification and thereby formally "conclude" the Additional Protocol. The US will "seek" legislative action to lift remaining sanctions, particularly "sanctions under the Iran, North Korea and Syria Nonproliferation Act on the acquisition of nuclear-related commodities and services for nuclear activities contemplated in the JCPOA." The EU will also lift further sanctions, in particular "proliferation-sensitive nuclear activities"--i.e. sanctions related to ballistic missiles.
Termination Day: 10 years from Adoption Day. The UN Security Resolution endorsing the JCPOA will terminate. The EU will terminate all remaining sanctions.
The agreement also contains a Dispute Resolution Mechanism. Under the mechanism, both Iran and any member of the P5+1 can refer complaints over the other side's not meeting its JCPOA commitments to the Joint Commission. The Joint Commission would have 15 days to resolve the issue unless "the time period was extended by consensus." If the Joint Commission fails to resolve the issue, the issue could be referred to "Ministers of Foreign Affairs," who would also have 15 days to resolves. Either alternatively to, or simultaneously with, the Ministers of Foreign Affairs stage, the issue could also be referred to an Advisory Board consisting of three members, one appointed by each party in the dispute and one appointed by an independent party. The Board would also have 15 days to review the dispute. If the dispute remains unresolved, the Joint Commission will have five days to review the opinion of the Board and attempt to resolve the issue.
If the issue is still unresolved after this process, the party bringing the complaint can cease performing its commitments under the JCPOA or notify the UN Security Council that the other party is involved in "significant non-performance." The UN Security Council would then have 30 days to vote on whether to continue lifting sanctions. Unless it adopts a resolution to continue sanctions relief, "the provisions of the old UN Security Council Resolutions [initially lifted on Implementation Day] would be re-imposed." The Security Council will "take into account" the views of the states involved in the dispute and of the Advisory Board.
(There seems to be some inartful language here, implying that the UNSC might both fail to pass a resolution on continuing sanctions lifting and prevent sanctions to be reinstated: "If the resolution described above [continuing sanctions suspensions] has not been adopted within 30 days of the notification, then the provisions of the old UN Security Council resolutions would be re-imposed, unless the UN Security Council decides otherwise." This last clause is either duplicative or is referencing some other unforeseen action.)
Finally, the text once again acknowledges (ominously) that "Iran has stated that if sanctions are reinstated in whole or in part, Iran will treat that as grounds to cease performing its commitments under this JCPOA in whole or in part."
After the main text, the agreement contains a number of annexes, which expand upon the components of the main text. ANNEX I: NUCLEAR RELATED MEASURES offers a myriad of technical details about limitations on Iran's nuclear activities, storage of its equipment and IAEA inspections. It provides details about the development and storage of centrifuges, the conversion of reactors, limits on enrichment and more (we have included much of this information above). It also details Iran's responsibilities to begin implementing the Additional Protocol, Modified Code 3.1, and the "Roadmap for Clarification of Past and Present Outstanding Issues."
Some of the annex's most crucial sections concern the IAEA's presence and capabilities within Iran. "For 15 years or longer," Iran will allow the IAEA to use "modern technologies" such as "on-line enrichment measurement" and will allow the installation of automatic measurement devices that will update IAEA inspectors on nuclear sites. Iran will also facilitate a "long-term IAEA presence" through the provision of visas and work-space. Within nine months of Implementation Day, Iran will increase the total number of IAEA inspectors allowed within Iran to between 130 and 150. For 25 years, Iran also guarantees the IAEA the ability to monitor and verify the use of uranium ore. For 15 years; it guarantees the IAEA "continuous monitoring" of stored materials in Natanz. For 20 years, Iran will take specified, necessary steps "for containment and surveillance on centrifuge rotor tubes and bellows" that Iran is keeping its agreement to limit uranium isotope separation-related research and activity to specified methods for 10 years.
The annex also specifies the process by which the IAEA deals with questions and suspicions: If the IAEA becomes concerned regarding "undeclared nuclear materials or activities... or activities inconsistent with the JCPOA," the Agency must notify Iran of its concerns, at which point Iran will have the opportunity to offer an explanation. If the IAEA isn't satisfied, it can request access to the sites in question and list the reasons for access "in writing," though Iran may propose alternate means of resolving the problem. If the sides are not able to reach agreement over access within 14 days of the IAEA's original request, Iran will consult the Joint Commission to resolve the issue. The Joint Commission will have seven days to reach a conclusion, which Iran will then have three days to implement.
Note that the Joint Commission can "advise on the necessary means" to resolve the dispute either by consensus, or by a vote of 5 out of 8 members-which means that the Commission would be able to reach a conclusion even if Russia, China, and Iran dissent. The annex also specifies that IAEA requests for access must be made "in good faith, with due observance of the sovereign rights of Iran," "kept to the minimum necessary," and "will not be aimed at interfering with Iranian military or other national security activities."
A final section bars Iran from participating in activities that could "contribute" to the construction of a nuclear bomb: developing or using computer models to "simulate" nuclear weapons, developing "multi-point explosive detonation systems" unless approved by the Joint Commission, developing "explosive diagnostic systems" or "explosively driven neutron sources." These prohibitions are of unspecified duration.
Lastly, the annex includes an extensive "conceptual design" for the redesign and reconstruction of Arak as a "modernised heavy water research reactor." This outline will provide the basis for the redesign that will be approved by the Joint Commission and implemented by Iran.
ANNEX II: SANCTIONS-RELATED COMMITMENTS provides a comprehensive list of US, EU, and UN sanctions that will be lifted by the deal. Most of this material is included in our summary of the "Sanctions" section above. Included as well is a set of " attachments " listing individuals who will be undesignated at various stages.
ANNEX III: CIVIL NUCLEAR COOPERATION describes cooperation between Iran and the P5+1, which can take place by mutual determination between the parties. Bilateral or multilateral agreements that do not include all members of the P5+1 are permitted as long as they are consistent with the JCPOA.
Parties of the P5+1 will "develop nuclear cooperation" with Iran in constructing and supplying nuclear technology, facilities, and fuel, particularly as regards the Arak Modernisation Project and Iran's acquisition of light-water research and power reactors. Iran and the P5+1 will also seek "scientific exchange" on nuclear research and cooperate in developing and implementing procedures in nuclear safety and nuclear security. This section also dictates that the P5+1 will work with Iran on the "effective and efficient implementation of IAEA safeguards and transparency measures." Interestingly, most of the language in this section makes fairly clear that these projects are largely optional: "[The P5+1] parties, as appropriate, are prepared to cooperate with Iran."
ANNEX IV: JOINT COMMISSION describes the standing body made of representatives of the P5+1, Iran, and the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy (an EU position). This last representative (or her designee) is the Coordinator of the Commission, who appears to take a somewhat administrative role (although she does not participate in decisions activities related to transfer of nuclear material outside Iran). The Commission will meet on a quarterly basis and at any time upon request of a member. Decisions are to be made by consensus except stated otherwise (as is the case if the IAEA and Iran bring a dispute to the Joint Commission over unreported nuclear sites), and each representative has one vote.
The Commission's remit is broad, including review, approval, and consultation of numerous aspects of the Iranian nuclear program, and resolution of disputes. The Commission is also responsible for establishing two Working Groups, one on procurement (i.e., sale of nuclear materials to and from Iran) and one on sanctions relief.
ANNEX V: IMPLEMENTATION PLAN offers an overview of what parts of the agreement will be implemented at the various stages. Most of the information from this section has been incorporated into our summary of the "Implementation Plan" section above.
Got all that? There will be a short quiz next period.
An atomic bomb can be made from two types of radioactive materials: uranium or plutonium. The talks were aimed at curbing Iran's ability to put these two elements to use in weapons. In each case, the manufacturing starts with uranium ore.  Uranium mined from the earth is less than 1 percent U-235, the isotope that can be used to fuel reactors and make bombs. Centrifuges are needed to separate the U-235 from the rest of the uranium, in a process called enrichment. The other fuel that can be used to make a bomb, plutonium, is made by irradiating uranium in a nuclear reactor. The process transforms some of the uranium into plutonium.
During the enrichment process, centrifuges are used to raise concentrations of U-235. For most power reactors in the West, uranium is enriched up to 5 percent. Bomb grade is above 90 percent and Iran had been processing ore to 20 percent enrichment. The agreement Iran has agreed to transform its deeply buried plant at Fordo into a center for science research. Another uranium plant, Natanz, is to be cut back rather than shut down. Some 5,000 centrifuges for enriching uranium will remain spinning there, about half the current number. Iran has also agreed to limit enrichment to 3.7 percent and to cap its stockpile of low-enriched uranium at 300 kilograms, or 660 pounds, for 15 years. That is considered insufficient for a bomb rush.
Iran was constructing a nuclear reactor at Arak that would have used natural uranium to produce Pu-239, which can fuel bombs. The agreement Iran has agreed to redesign and rebuild the Arak reactor so it will not produce weapons-grade plutonium. The original core of the reactor, which would enable the production of weapons-grade plutonium, will be made inoperable, but will stay in the country. Under the terms of the deal, the reactor's spent fuel, which could also be used to produce a bomb, will be shipped out of the country. Iran will not build any additional heavy water reactors for 15 years.
More than twice the size of Texas in area, Iran poses many challenges for atomic inspectors who have to police the agreement and gain access not only to scientists, labs and factories, but also to many underground sites and military bases. Western allies say the new inspections must be far more intrusive than those in the past, given the deal's sweeping terms as well as Iran's history of evasions, stonewalling and illicit procurements. The principal concerns are how to detect cheating and covert sites. The agreement Iran has agreed to provide the International Atomic Energy Agency greater access and information regarding its nuclear program, and to allow the agency to investigate suspicious sites or allegations of covert facilities related to uranium enrichment anywhere in the country. Inspectors will also have access to the supply chain that supports Iran's nuclear program, including uranium mines and mills, and to continuous surveillance of centrifuge manufacturing and storage facilities.
The deal requires Iran to reduce its current stockpile of low-enriched uranium by 98 percent, and limits Iran's enrichment capacity and research and development for 15 years. Some inspections and transparency measures will remain in place for as long as 25 years. According to President Obama: "This relief will be phased in. Iran must complete key nuclear steps before it begins to receive sanctions relief." Sanctions for arms could be lifted in five years, ballistic missiles in eight.
The agreement increases the "breakout" time - the amount of time it would take Iran to produce enough bomb-grade material for a singular nuclear weapon - to at least one year.
Additional work by Larry Buchanan, Josh Keller, K.K. Rebecca Lai, David E. Sanger and Karen Yourish. 
VIENNA - Iran and a group of six nations led by the United States reached a historic accord on Tuesday to significantly limit Tehran's nuclear ability for more than a decade in return for lifting international oil and financial sanctions.
The deal culminates 20 months of negotiations on an agreement that President Obama had long sought as the biggest diplomatic achievement of his presidency. Whether it portends a new relationship between the United States and Iran - after decades of coups, hostage-taking, terrorism and sanctions - remains a bigger question.
Mr. Obama, in an early morning appearance at the White House that was broadcast live in Iran, began what promised to be an arduous effort to sell the deal to Congress and the American public, saying the agreement is "not built on trust - it is built on verification."
He made it abundantly clear he would fight to preserve the deal from critics in Congress who are beginning a 60-day review, declaring, "I will veto any legislation that prevents the successful implementation of this deal."
Almost as soon as the agreement was announced, to cheers in Vienna and on the streets of Tehran, its harshest critics said it would ultimately empower Iran rather than limit its capability. Israel's prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, called it a "historic mistake" that would create a "terrorist nuclear superpower."
A review of the 109-page text of the agreement, which includes five annexes, showed that the United States preserved - and in some cases extended - the nuclear restrictions it sketched out with Iran in early April in Lausanne, Switzerland.
Yet, it left open areas that are sure to raise fierce objections in Congress. It preserves Iran's ability to produce as much nuclear fuel as it wishes after year 15 of the agreement, and allows it to conduct research on advanced centrifuges after the eighth year. Moreover, the Iranians won the eventual lifting of an embargo on the import and export of conventional arms and ballistic missiles - a step the departing chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Martin E. Dempsey, warned about just last week.
American officials said the core of the agreement, secured in 18 consecutive days of talks here, lies in the restrictions on the amount of nuclear fuel that Iran can keep for the next 15 years. The current stockpile of low enriched uranium will be reduced by 98 percent, most likely by shipping much of it to Russia.
That limit, combined with a two-thirds reduction in the number of its centrifuges, would extend to a year the amount of time it would take Iran to make enough material for a single bomb should it abandon the accord and race for a weapon - what officials call "breakout time." By comparison, analysts say Iran now has a breakout time of two to three months.
But American officials also acknowledged that after the first decade, the breakout time would begin to shrink. It was unclear how rapidly, because Iran's longer-term plans to expand its enrichment capability will be kept confidential.
The concern that Iran's breakout time could shrink sharply in the waning years of the restrictions has already been a contentious issue in Congress. Mr. Obama contributed to that in an interview with National Public Radio in April, when he said that in "year 13, 14, 15" of the agreement, the breakout time might shrink "almost down to zero," as Iran is expected to develop and use advanced centrifuges then.
Pressed on that point, an American official who briefed reporters on Tuesday said that Iran's long-term plans to expand its enrichment capability would be shared with the International Atomic Energy Agency and other parties to the accord.
"It is going to be a gradual decline," the official said. "At the end of, say, 15 years, we are not going to know what that is." But clearly there are intelligence agency estimates, and one diplomat involved in the talks said that internal estimates suggested Iran's breakout time could shrink to about five months in year 14 of the plan.
Secretary of State John Kerry, who led the negotiations for the United States in the final rounds, sought in his remarks Tuesday to blunt criticism on this point. "Iran will not produce or acquire highly enriched uranium" or plutonium for at least 15 years, he said. Verification measures, he added, will "stay in place permanently."
He stressed that Tehran and the International Atomic Energy Agency had "entered into an agreement to address all questions" about Iran's past actions within three months, and that completing this task was "fundamental for sanctions relief."
Compared with many past efforts to slow a nation's nuclear program - including a deal struck with North Korea 20 years ago - this agreement is remarkably specific. Nevertheless, some mysteries remain. For example, it is not clear whether the inspectors would be able to interview the scientists and engineers who were believed to have been at the center of an effort by the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps to design a weapon that Iran could manufacture in short order.
In building his argument for the deal, Mr. Obama stressed that the accord was vastly preferable to the alternate scenario: no agreement and an unbridled nuclear arms race in the Middle East. "Put simply, no deal means a greater chance of more war in the Middle East," he said. He said his successors in the White House "will be in a far stronger position" to restrain Iran for decades to come than they would be without the pact.
In an interview Tuesday with Thomas L. Friedman, an Op-Ed columnist with The New York Times, Mr. Obama also answered Mr. Netanyahu and other critics who, he said, would prefer that the Iranians "don't even have any nuclear capacity." Mr. Obama said, "But really, what that involves is eliminating the presence of knowledge inside of Iran." Since that is not realistic, the president added, "The question is, Do we have the kind of inspection regime and safeguards and international consensus whereby it's not worth it for them to do it? We have accomplished that."
As news of a nuclear deal spread, Iranians reacted with a mix of jubilation, cautious optimism and disbelief that decades of a seemingly intractable conflict could be coming to an end.
"Have they really reached a deal?" asked Masoud Derakhshani, a 93-year-old widower who had come down to the lobby of his apartment building for his daily newspaper. Mr. Derakhshani remained cautious, even incredulous. "I can't believe it," he said. "They will most probably hit some last-minute snag."
Across Tehran, many Iranians expressed hope for better economic times after years in which crippling sanctions have severely depressed the value of the national currency, the rial. That in turn caused inflation and shortages of goods, including vital medicines, and forced Iranians to carry fat wads of bank notes to pay for everyday items such as meat, rice and beans.
"I am desperate to feed my three sons," said Ali, 53, a cleaner. "This deal should bring investment for jobs so they can start working for a living."
National dignity, a major demand of Iran's leader, did not matter to him, he said. "I really do not care if this is a victory for us or not," he said. "I want relations with the West. If we compromised, so be it."
Iran's president, Hassan Rouhani, who was elected in 2013 on a platform of ridding the country of the sanctions, said that the Iranian people's "prayers have come true."
One of the last, and most contentious, issues was the question of whether and how fast an arms embargo on conventional weapons and missiles, imposed starting in 2006, would be lifted.
After days of haggling, Secretary of State Kerry and his Iranian counterpart, Mohammad Javad Zarif, agreed that the missile restrictions would remain for eight years and that a similar ban on the purchase and sale of conventional weapons would be removed in five years.
Those bans would be removed even sooner if the International Atomic Energy Agency reached a definitive conclusion that the Iranian nuclear program is entirely peaceful, and that there was no evidence of cheating on the accord or any activity to obtain weapons covertly.
The provisions on the arms embargo are expected to dominate the coming debate in Congress on the accord.
Even before the deal was announced, critics expressed fears that Iran would use some of the billions of dollars it will receive after sanctions relief to build up its military power. Iranian officials, however, have said that Iran should be treated like any other nation, and not be subjected to an arms embargo if it meets the terms of a nuclear deal.
Defending the outcome, Mr. Kerry told reporters here that China and Russia had favored lifting the entire arms embargo immediately, suggesting he had no choice but to try to strike a middle ground.
Mr. Kerry appeared to secure another commitment that was not part of a preliminary agreement negotiated in Lausanne. Iranian officials agreed here on a multiyear ban on designing warheads and conducting tests, including with detonators and nuclear triggers, that would contribute to the design and manufacture of a nuclear weapon. Accusations that Tehran conducted that kind of research in the past led to a standoff with inspectors.
Diplomats also came up with unusual procedure to "snap back" the sanctions against Iran if an eight-member panel determines that Tehran is violating the nuclear provisions. The members of the panel are Britain, China, France, Germany, Russia, the United States, the European Union and Iran itself. A majority vote is required, meaning that Russia, China and Iran could not collectively block action.
With the announcement of the accord, Mr. Obama has now made major strides toward fundamentally changing the American diplomatic relationships with three nations: Cuba, Iran and Myanmar. Of the three, Iran is the most strategically important, the only one with a nuclear program, and it is still on the State Department's list of state sponsors of terrorism.
While the agreement faces heavy opposition from Republicans in Congress, and even some Democrats, Mr. Obama's chances of prevailing are considered high. Even if the accord is voted down by one or both houses, he could veto that action, and he is likely to have the votes he would need to override the veto. But he has told aides that for an accord as important as this one - which he hopes will usher in a virtual truce with a country that has been a major American adversary for 35 years - he wants a congressional endorsement.
Mr. Obama will also have to manage the breach with Mr. Netanyahu and the leaders of Saudi Arabia and other Arab states who have warned against the deal, saying the relief of sanctions will ultimately empower the Iranians throughout the Middle East.
Since its completion in Vienna on July 14, the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA)-the nuclear deal between Iran and the P5+1 countries-has been the focus of formal congressional hearings, countless private briefings, exhaustive media coverage, strenuous lobbying efforts, and intense public scrutiny. From the initial skirmishes between supporters and opponents, we now have a good idea of the battleground issues that will drive the debate when Congress returns from its summer recess and prepares to vote on the agreement.
Many elements of the JCPOA are widely seen as positive, even by skeptics, and are unlikely to be hotly debated in the weeks ahead.
Deep reductions in installed centrifuges and enriched uranium stocks, as well as other constraints on enrichment capacity, will reliably lengthen the time it would take Iran to produce enough weapons-grade uranium for a single bomb to at least one year for at least the first 10 years of the agreement.
The re-design of the Arak heavy water reactor, the shipment of its spent fuel out of Iran, and the 15-year ban on reprocessing will effectively block the plutonium path to a bomb for the foreseeable future.
Limits on research and development of advanced centrifuges for the first 10 years are highly restrictive, allowing Iran to test only single machines or very small cascades. Testing of Iran's most advanced centrifuges in larger, operationally-sized cascades can only take place after a decade, delaying deployment and operation in significant numbers.
The agreement ensures high confidence in the ability to detect non-compliance at declared facilities because of the use of advanced verification technologies and the scope and intensity of monitoring arrangements, including continuous surveillance and inventory accounting of activities not usually subject to such rigorous monitoring (e.g., production of uranium ore concentrate and centrifuge rotors and bellows).
The procedure for resolving disputes over site access will allow the United States and its European partners to overrule Iran (even if supported by Russia and China) and require it to grant the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) access to any location, ensuring that military installations will not be out of bounds to inspectors.
The JCPOA makes clear, notwithstanding earlier Iranian rhetoric about sanctions being terminated on the day a deal is reached, that Tehran will not receive sanctions relief until the IAEA confirms that Iran has fulfilled its key nuclear commitments, including moving roughly 13,000 excess centrifuges to monitored storage, reducing enriched uranium stocks from well over 10,000 kilograms to 300 kilograms, and removing and disabling the core of the Arak heavy water reactor.
Under an unprecedented snap-back procedure, if the United States charges Iran with significant non-performance of its commitments, previous Security Council sanctions will be restored, unless a new, veto-able Security Council resolution is adopted that maintains the suspension of sanctions.
The annexes contain numerous detailed, technical agreements that will minimize ambiguities and should reduce implementation problems down the road. 
In coming weeks, as Congress and the American public evaluate the Iran nuclear deal, other, more controversial aspects of the JCPOA-the battleground issues-are likely to command the main focus of what promises to be a knock-down, drag-out fight.
1. What happens to Iran's nuclear program after the deal's first decade?
An issue likely to receive much attention, deservedly so, is what happens in the "out years"-the later years of the deal, when some key restrictions on Iran's enrichment capacity begin to expire. JCPOA limits will ensure that, at least for 10 years, Iran would need at least one year to produce enough weapons-grade uranium to build a bomb, if it decides to breach the agreement. But as Iran becomes free to increase the number of operating centrifuges and introduce more advanced types (after 10 years) and to increase its enrichment level and stocks of enriched uranium (after 15 years), breakout time will decrease and eventually shrink to a matter of weeks-leaving Iran with a "threshold" nuclear weapons capability. Critics assert that allowing Iran to ramp up its enrichment capacity in the "out years" means that the deal merely postpones but does not prevent a nuclear-armed Iran.
There are two separate "out-year" issues. The first is how rapidly Iran can increase its enrichment capacity and thereby shorten breakout time in the second decade of the agreement. The second is whether Iran can be prevented from building nuclear weapons once the breakout time is reduced to a few weeks.
On the first issue, several elements of the nuclear deal will impede Iran's ability to rapidly boost its enrichment capacity. Strict limits on research and development in the first 10 years will require Iran to do further R&D on advanced centrifuges after 10 years, delaying the time those machines could be deployed and operated. Moreover, maintaining the 300-kilogram cap on enriched uranium stocks and the 3.67 percent cap on enrichment levels for 15 years will further slow the rate at which breakout time will decrease between years 10 and 15.
Also important, as part of its obligations under the Additional Protocol, Iran will submit a plan to the IAEA this fall indicating the rate at which it will increase its enrichment program up to year 14, including any plans for introducing more advanced centrifuges. Under the JCPOA, Iran commits itself to abide by that plan. The P5+1 countries are aware of the plan's key elements, which have been briefed in confidence to Congress. Reportedly, the plan indicates that Iran will increase its enrichment program at a gradual pace, not race to an industrial-scale capability that its leaders describe as their goal.
On the basis of these factors, it is expected that, at least until year 14, breakout time will be significantly greater than it is at present, perhaps in the neighborhood of half a year. If Iran encounters technical problems in developing or manufacturing advanced centrifuges-which would not be surprising given the difficulties it experienced with the IR-1 first-generation machines-breakout time will decline more slowly.
Still, whatever the rate of decline, at some point-likely between years 15 and 20-Iran will be able to increase enrichment capacity sufficiently to lower breakout time to a few weeks. At that point, the question becomes whether Iran can be prevented from making the decision to cross the threshold and build nuclear weapons.
Critics argue that, once Iran has gotten that close to the nuclear threshold, it will have a clear path ahead to nuclear weapons and will almost surely embark on that path at a time of its choosing. But it is far from certain that Iran's leaders-having paid the huge price of devastating sanctions and international isolation for pursuing nuclear weapons-would judge that nuclear arms are a national imperative. Much would depend on how, at the time, they viewed their regional security environment, whether they thought their national aspirations could be met without nuclear weapons, and how they perceived other nations would react to their deceit in violating their international obligations and declared religious principles.
The idea that Iran ultimately may not opt for nuclear weapons is consistent with repeated assessments by the U.S. intelligence community. Since 2007, the intelligence community has judged that, while Iran's leaders have kept open the option to pursue nuclear weapons, they have not made the decision to do so.
But even if Iranian leaders, after 15 years or more, believed their national interests were best served by having nuclear weapons, they would run major risks in going forward, with no guarantee of success. Even in the 'out years,' the JCPOA's rigorous monitoring arrangements will remain in force. The world will have gained intimate knowledge of Iran's nuclear program, which would give the United States prompt warning of any Iranian effort to make a dash for the bomb. Even if breakout time had declined to a few weeks, the United States would likely have sufficient time to intervene militarily to stop them. And during the preceding years, the United States will have pursued more effective intelligence means to discover, and more effective military means to thwart, any Iranian movement toward building the bomb.
It would have been preferable to have permanent or longer-term restrictions on Iran's enrichment program to preserve a one-year breakout time well beyond 15 years. But preventing a nuclear-armed Iran is possible without longer-lasting restrictions-provided the United States and key partners maintain a strong and credible deterrent against a future Iranian decision to go for the bomb. To that end, current and future U.S. presidents, explicitly supported by Congress, should declare that it is U.S. policy to prevent Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons and that the United States will use any necessary means, including military force, to enforce that policy.
2. How does the deal address concerns about the possible military dimensions of Iran's past nuclear work?
Another battleground issue involves persistent IAEA efforts, long frustrated by Iranian stonewalling, to gain a better understanding of past Iranian research, experimentation, and procurement believed to be related to the development of nuclear weapons. On July 14, 2015, Iran and the IAEA agreed on a "roadmap" aimed at resolving all outstanding issues related to the "possible military dimensions" (PMD) of Iran's nuclear program. The roadmap provides for "technical-expert meetings" and "technical measures"-presumably IAEA interviews with Iranian scientists and IAEA access to documents and certain sites. Those agreed activities, all of which are to be completed by October 15, are contained in separate, confidential agreements. By December 15, the IAEA director general will provide his final assessment of the PMD issue to the agency's board of governors and the U.N. Security Council.
Iran's completion of all agreed roadmap steps by October 15 is a prerequisite-along with Iran's implementation of several other nuclear-related commitments-for the suspension of U.S., EU, and U.N. sanctions. The confidential nature of Iran's roadmap steps reflects the IAEA's standard practice of confidentiality on safeguards matters, but this has understandably caused a stir on Capitol Hill, especially because sanctions relief depends on fulfillment of those steps.
The IAEA's professional judgment is that implementation of the agreed steps would provide the agency what it needs to gain an adequate understanding of the PMD issue. But U.S. legislators want to make their own evaluation of those steps before casting votes on the JCPOA. Administration officials apparently are not in possession of the detailed IAEA-Iran arrangements, although they are aware of the key elements. To address legitimate congressional concerns, they have confidentially briefed those elements to members. Moreover, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee held a closed-door session with IAEA Director General Yukiya Amano on August 5 to discuss the roadmap.
Implementation of the roadmap may well give the IAEA greater insights into past Iranian activities than it has gained to date. But even if Iran takes the formal steps required by the roadmap-grants the required access to scientists, documents, and sites-it is hard to imagine that Iranian cooperation with the IAEA will be sufficiently forthcoming or that Iranian responses to IAEA questions will be sufficiently complete and truthful to give the IAEA a full understanding of those activities. As a result, the director general's December report is likely to be inconclusive, indicating progress in clarifying certain issues but noting questions and concerns that remain. It may say, on the one hand, that the agency is unaware of evidence that weaponization activities continue but, on the other, that it cannot conclude that past activities were not nuclear weapons-related.
Clearly, such an outcome of the PMD issue would not be very satisfying. But a full and honest disclosure by Iran of its past weaponization activities-which would contradict Tehran's narrative of an exclusively peaceful program as well the supreme leader's fatwa that Islam forbids nuclear weapons-was never in the cards. The key question is whether the absence of a full Iranian confession regarding its past activities is a serious obstacle to achieving confidence that Iran is not pursuing nuclear weapons going forward.
The answer to this question will be vigorously debated. However, considering the range of tools we will have for preventing a nuclear-armed Iran, including but not limited to those provided in the JCPOA, the failure to achieve full knowledge of the past does not represent a critical deficiency.
The JCPOA contains a number of provisions that can help deter and prevent future weaponization activities. Correcting a serious omission in the Non-Proliferation Treaty, it explicitly commits Iran not to engage in a range of specific activities related to the development of nuclear weapons, including certain work in uranium and plutonium metallurgy, nuclear explosive modeling, research on explosive detonation and neutron initiation systems, and procurement of specialized equipment for those purposes. In addition, Security Council restrictions on importing sensitive technologies for military end-uses, together with the consensus approval procedure for the procurement channel set up to allow nuclear and dual-use items for peaceful purposes, will impede Iranian attempts to import materials and equipment relevant to weaponization. And the deal's provisions that ensure IAEA access to any locations in Iran where illicit activities are suspected of taking place (discussed below) can play a role, albeit a modest one, in discouraging future nuclear weapons-related activities.
In addition to the tools provided in the agreement, the international community will need to rely heavily on national intelligence capabilities, especially those of the United States and its foreign partners, to discover any future work on weaponization. Indeed, what we know about Iran's past weapons-related activities comes primarily from Western intelligence sources. Keeping the Iran nuclear issue near the top of U.S. intelligence priorities may be the most promising way to address weaponization going forward.
Some observers have argued that full knowledge of past activities is necessary to design an effective verification system for the future. But the relevance of activities over 12 years ago to devising today's monitoring arrangements is not clear. Would the Iranians return to the same sites they used for weaponization activities previously? Would future weapons-related activities be confined to the same personnel who participated before?
More fundamentally, the challenge of detecting small-scale weaponization work is much greater than the challenge of monitoring higher-profile, less easily concealed activities related to the production of fissile materials. With or without full knowledge of the past, it is hard to imagine reaching agreement on monitoring arrangements intrusive enough to provide confidence that Iran has no ongoing weaponization activities. For example, among the measures that could be helpful in providing such confidence would be arrangements for closely and frequently keeping track of the activities of Iranian scientists with the necessary expertise or for verifying on site the end-uses of equipment throughout Iran that could be used in nuclear weapons design and diagnostics.
However, such intrusive arrangements are simply unrealistic. No sovereign state will permit that level of external scrutiny. Full knowledge of past Iranian activities would not make it any easier to persuade Tehran to accept such monitoring. That is why deterring weaponization activities must depend less on agreed monitoring measures and more on intelligence capabilities, procurement restrictions, and the threat of harsh penalties for violations.
Some analysts argue that, in order to calculate how much time we would have to intervene and thwart an Iranian attempt to break out and build nuclear weapons, we need to know how much progress Iran made in its past weaponization efforts-and that this requires full disclosure by Iran of its past activities. But why would we depend on Iranian accounts of how far they had progressed, especially when they would have incentives to mislead us, most likely to understate how far they had gotten?
From our own sources, we already have considerable knowledge of past Iranian activities-not "absolute knowledge" as U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry claimed in a recent misstatement, but a significant amount. Moreover, in calculating the time available to thwart an Iranian breakout attempt, we would have to make the conservative assumption that Iran had made major headway on weaponization, and that going from the production of weapons-grade uranium to the fabrication of a workable nuclear weapon would not be a significant challenge. It is unlikely that anything Iranian scientists might tell the IAEA about activities before 2003 (when dedicated weaponization research is believed to have been suspended) would affect U.S. planning for interrupting an Iranian dash for nuclear weapons.
It would certainly be preferable for Iran to come clean on its past weaponization work, not because it would have much practical utility in devising the agreement's monitoring measures or in planning to thwart a possible future breakout, but because an admission of past nuclear weapons intent would provide greater confidence that Iran had made a strategic decision to abandon any aspiration to acquire nuclear arms. Unfortunately, Iran will not come clean, and that will perpetuate concerns about its intentions.
Still, with vigorous enforcement of the JCPOA, aggressive intelligence-gathering, and the credible threat of forceful intervention in the event of an Iranian breakout attempt, it is possible to deter Iran from exercising the option to build nuclear weapons, even if the outcome on the PMD issue is less than fully satisfactory. And if Iran's implementation of the PMD roadmap does not allay IAEA concerns and leads to an inconclusive report in December, the PMD file should stay open over the next several years as the IAEA considers the "broader conclusion" on whether Iran's nuclear program is exclusively peaceful-the conclusion that would provide the basis for a future U.S. administration to ask Congress to terminate, not just suspend, statutory sanctions.
3. Is IAEA access to sensitive sites timely enough?
Another battleground issue that has gained prominence in recent weeks is whether the JCPOA's provisions on IAEA access to suspect sites-beyond those declared sites that will be subject to continuous verification-can effectively deter and detect covert violations of the agreement. The text of the agreement has largely put to rest concerns that the IAEA might be denied access to such suspect sites-concerns heightened by statements from Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, that access to military sites would cross one of his redlines. The JCPOA's provisions for resolving access disputes-under which a Joint Commission can, by majority vote, require Iran to grant access or face the Security Council's restoration of sanctions-provide assurance that Tehran cannot get away with blocking access to any location in the country.
The main controversy on access involves the question of whether IAEA inspectors will be admitted to suspect facilities in a timely fashion-in particular, whether they will gain access before Iran is able to hide or remove evidence of illicit activities. Although the IAEA Additional Protocol does not establish a time limit after which parties are required to admit inspectors, the P5+1 insisted on imposing one on Iran in the JCPOA. It provides for a maximum of 24 days from the time the IAEA requests access to the time Iran must accede to a Joint Commission decision to provide access. In a breakout scenario, the time limit would prevent the Iranians from stalling indefinitely in the hope of buying time for breakout activities to advance before the United States or others could intervene to stop them.
Critics argue that 24 days would give Iran plenty of opportunity to eliminate incriminating evidence before inspectors can arrive-either by simply moving equipment or materials to another location or scrubbing the facility of any physical traces of illicit activity.
Supporters of the agreement point out that it would not be possible in 24 days to hide evidence of covert production facilities, such as conversion and enrichment plants or centrifuge manufacturing workshops, or other relatively large objects, such as a high-explosive chamber. Moreover, they maintain that sophisticated environmental sampling technologies would have a good chance of detecting microscopic traces of covert activity if uranium or other nuclear materials were involved, even long after 24 days. And they argue that, as soon as the IAEA requests an inspection, U.S. intelligence assets would focus on the suspect site and be able to identify signs that incriminating cleanup efforts were underway.
The critics are right that removal and cleanup efforts could be successfully completed within 24 days in the case of small-scale illicit activities, especially if no nuclear materials are involved. Moreover, although intelligence assets have in the past detected efforts to sanitize sites-notably at Iran's Parchin facility-detection of such efforts cannot be counted on in all instances.
In the absence of no-notice, surprise inspections-which have only been achieved in a case like Iraq, where the Security Council was in a position to dictate terms to a defeated country-no inspection system can reliably ensure on-site confirmation of small-scale, non-nuclear activities. Even a system requiring access to be granted in a week or even several days, which some of the critics advocate, could not provide such assurance. The inspection system established under the JCPOA is not perfect, but it is timely enough to prevent the removal or concealment of incriminating evidence of the kind of illicit activities that would be of greatest concern and would most significantly lessen Iran's breakout time.
Moreover, responding to Iranian violations need not depend on proof gathered by the IAEA on site. While an IAEA inspection that catches Iran red-handed would probably provide the strongest basis for going to the Security Council and re-imposing sanctions, the United States would not need to wait for IAEA confirmation of Iranian cheating. If the United States acquired reliable intelligence of Iranian violations that posed a serious security threat and could be shared with others, the nuclear deal enables Washington to go directly to the Security Council without waiting for IAEA access. Indeed, depending on the scale and time-urgency of the threat, the United States could choose to act on its own to penalize Iran.
Inspections are only one component of the JCPOA's comprehensive monitoring system. Continuous surveillance of the entire nuclear supply chain, including the prohibition of sensitive imports other than those individually approved and monitored for legitimate purposes, will make it difficult for Iran to pursue an undetected covert enrichment program. To succeed, a covert program requires not just a single clandestine site but a substantial number of effectively hidden facilities and undetected movement of equipment and materials between them. It requires unaccounted-for or successfully diverted supplies of uranium ore, processed uranium, uranium gas, centrifuge components, and facilities designed to produce those supplies. The JCPOA's layered monitoring system will greatly increase the likelihood of detecting one or more of the necessary elements of a covert program and provide a substantial deterrent to Iranian cheating.
"Anywhere, anytime" inspections were never a possibility. But the approach to inspections outlined in the nuclear deal can prevent extended foot-dragging, facilitate IAEA confirmation of violations that cannot be rapidly covered up, and heighten the perceived risks to Iran of cheating-all of which make a significant contribution to the JCPOA's overall verification system.
4. What is the significance of restrictions on conventional arms transfers and ballistic missile activities?
An issue that was only resolved in the final days of negotiations and has become controversial since then is the question of restrictions on Iran's export and import of conventional arms and on its ballistic missile program. These restrictions were part of the Security Council sanctions in place prior to the conclusion of the JCPOA. Iran, supported by Russia and China, pressed for eliminating them at the same time other Security Council sanctions are removed, but the United States insisted on preserving them in a new council resolution. A compromise was reached on their duration, with the conventional arms embargo lasting five more years and the ballistic missile restrictions lasting eight more years.
The original Security Council restrictions were adopted as punishment for Iran's violations of its nuclear obligations and as an inducement to negotiate a nuclear deal. The restrictions were not intended to be permanent; their termination was linked to an agreement that would provide confidence in the peaceful nature of Iran's nuclear program. Given that reality and strong pressures for immediate repeal by Iran, Russia, and China, it was a significant accomplishment to have preserved the restrictions at all.
Critics have attacked the expiration of the restrictions after five and eight years. They maintain that, once the restrictions end, Iran will be free dramatically to increase its military capabilities and threaten its neighbors. Moreover, the Iranians have made clear that, even during the five-year and eight-year periods, they will not consider themselves bound by the renewed conventional arms and ballistic missile constraints, just as they did not consider themselves bound by the original Security Council restrictions, which they termed illegal. They say they are only committed to comply with their commitments under the JCPOA and have given every indication that they will disregard and seek to circumvent the renewed council restrictions.
But even though the conventional arms and ballistic missile restrictions have finite durations and even though Iran has no intention to comply with them, they are well worth having. They will prevent Tehran from using the $100-plus billion in previously frozen oil revenues that will be released under the JCPOA to go on a buying spree next year for advanced conventional weaponry and ballistic missile technology. Although Iran will seek to evade the renewed restrictions, Russia and China voted for them and, together with other U.N. members, will be bound to enforce them. Although the arms embargo does not cover all categories of arms (air defense systems such as the S-300 are not included), neither Russia nor China is expected to sell Iran the weapons that are covered, such as high-performance aircraft.
During the five- and eight-year reprieves on the termination of the restrictions, the United States and its partners will have time to strengthen their regional conventional military and missile defense capabilities. To maintain the qualitative advantages currently held by Israel and several Gulf Arab states, Congress should approve proposed arms sales to the Gulf Arabs and pass a new 10-year Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) for military assistance to Israel, which should include additional funding for the development and deployment of the next stage of the Arrow ballistic missile defense system.
The continuation of conventional arms and missile restrictions will also provide international legitimacy to efforts by the United States and others to interdict shipments and stop transactions that violate the restrictions. Should the United States receive intelligence or other information about Iranian attempts to procure arms or technology illicitly or to export arms (of any category) to its proxies, it will have the Security Council's continuing authorization to take steps to block such transfers, and it can call on other U.N. members to cooperate in enforcing the Council's mandated restrictions.
Even after the renewed Security Council restrictions expire, the United States will have other legal authorities and policy tools to address Iranian arms transfers to its proxies and imports of sensitive technologies. Existing U.N. embargoes on transfers to Hezbollah, the Yemeni Houthis, and Shiite militants in Iraq require U.N. members to prevent prohibited transfers from or through their territory. Other available policy tools include the Proliferation Security Initiative which facilitates international cooperation in interdicting illicit transfers, U.S. sanctions laws which target certain Iranian conventional arms and missile activities, and the Missile Technology Control Regime which coordinates the missile export policies of the major missile supplying governments, including Russia.
5. What are the implications of sanctions relief, including release of $100-plus billion in restricted assets?
The nuclear deal's provisions on sanctions relief have generated many important questions-including whether relief would be conditioned on Iran's performance, whether major and early relief would forfeit too much leverage needed to incentivize continued Iranian compliance, whether sanctions can be restored in the event of non-compliance, and whether Iran will be penalized for behavior outside the nuclear realm.
Obama administration officials have addressed many of these questions-not to the full satisfaction of the deal's critics but enough to allay some of the most serious concerns. They have pointed out that, under the nuclear deal:
Sanctions relief will follow, not precede, Iran's implementation of key nuclear commitments. 
Existing sanctions for non-nuclear-related Iranian behavior (e.g., support for terrorism, human rights abuses) will remain in force, and additional sanctions can be imposed, including on entities no longer sanctioned for nuclear reasons. 
A substantial number of entities on the U.S. sanctions list will remain on the list for eight years or indefinitely (including the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps-IRGC-and its regional arm, the Quds Force, and various military and missile entities). 
Foreign banks and other entities dealing with those that remain on the sanctions list will be subject to being cut off from the U.S. financial system. 
U.S. sanctions can be restored in a matter of days if Iran violates its commitments, and Security Council sanctions can be snapped back automatically within 30 days if a single JCPOA party charges Iran with significant non-performance of its commitments. 
Entities that legally enter into contracts before the snap-back of Security Council sanctions will be subject to sanctions if they do not stop or wind down the implementation of any such contracts covered by the restored sanctions. Contrary to an impression created by convoluted language in the JCPOA text, those contracts will not be grandfathered. 
Although the JCPOA clearly provides for snap-back, legitimate questions remain about whether businesses and governments will conscientiously go along with the re-imposition of sanctions, especially if they have established a strong commercial or political stake in remaining engaged with Iran. Much will depend on the seriousness of the Iranian violation that triggered the re-imposition and the strength of the evidence that a violation had been committed. Strong, shareable evidence of major violations, such as breakout preparations, would facilitate the reassembling of the international sanctions coalition. Weaker evidence or less serious infractions would make it harder.
The Obama administration should engage now with key international partners to sensitize them to the possible future need to restore sanctions, in whole or in part, and to develop procedures and contingency plans for doing so. It should build support for rigorous enforcement of compliance from the outset, addressing and resolving promptly the inevitable implementation problems that will arise and not allowing even minor violations of the JCPOA to proceed without an appropriately firm response.
One sanctions relief issue that remains highly controversial is what the Iranians will do with the oil revenues held in restricted overseas bank accounts that will be released to them on "implementation day," when the major tranche of nuclear-related sanctions will be suspended. Critics of the nuclear deal, both at home and abroad, regard the released funds-somewhere in the neighborhood of $100 billion-as a windfall that will enable Iran to devote substantial additional resources to destabilizing its neighbors and expanding its regional influence, including by boosting assistance to its proxies and allies in Lebanon, Syria, Iraq, Bahrain, Gaza, and Yemen and strengthening the capabilities of the IRGC's Quds Force. They note that, unlike the ability to reverse the suspension of most other sanctions, the previously frozen assets, once released, will be unrecoverable.
The administration has tried to minimize the potential adverse effects of the released funds. In a hearing of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on July 23, U.S. Treasury Secretary Jack Lew pointed out that, of the roughly $100 billion in released funds, about half are already committed to meeting outstanding obligations, including payments to China for infrastructure projects, leaving Tehran with approximately $50 billion not yet spoken for. Administration officials have maintained that Iran will likely give priority to the huge expenditures needed for rehabilitating its economy, which Lew said would require well over $500 billion in pressing investment requirements and government obligations.
Administration officials also point out that, for the IRGC-the organization many critics believe will be a major beneficiary from released assets-sanctions relief will be a mixed blessing. While it may gain access to additional funds, it will also likely lose out on profits derived from its control over the black market for sanctioned goods and sectors-at least part of the explanation why the IRGC opposes the nuclear deal.
Still, the release of the restricted assets clearly poses risks. Even if only half the released $100 billion is uncommitted and even if the lion's share of those uncommitted funds will go to addressing Iran's economic woes, which seems like a very safe assumption, even a small fraction of the released assets could make a significant difference if allocated to supporting Tehran's aggressive regional behavior, including arming and funding proxies like Hezbollah and the Assad regime in Syria. This is the source of deep concern among America's Gulf Arab friends and Israel.
The most effective U.S. response to the risks posed by the released assets is not to scuttle the deal or to try to re-negotiate a phased or substantially delayed release which, given the priority the Iranians attached to early recovery of the funds, would have little chance of success. Instead, Washington should work with its partners to counter Iranian provocations. That means stepping up interdictions of illicit arms shipments, strengthening counter-terrorism efforts (including impeding and sanctioning terrorism financing), building up the capacities of America's friends, and in general demonstrating U.S. resolve to play a strong leadership role in the region, including opposing Tehran's aggressive regional designs.
Critics of the nuclear deal are correct that nothing in the JCPOA prevents Iran from continuing to engage in destabilizing regional behavior. By the same token, nothing prevents the United States and its partners from countering that behavior, including by imposing sanctions not removed by the JCPOA and by employing a wide range of available policy tools to counter terrorism and illicit arms trafficking. Moreover, while the released assets will put additional resources at Tehran's disposal, those funds are much more than offset by the substantially greater resources that the United States and its Gulf Arab partners can bring to bear to address the regional challenges posed by Iran.
At the Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing, Secretary Lew stated that the United States "will aggressively target any attempts by Iran to use funds gained from sanctions relief to support militant proxies." U.S. partners in the region will be watching closely to see if Washington follows through on that pledge.
6. What are the consequences of rejecting the deal?
As a congressional vote on the JCPOA nears, the debate over the consequences of disapproval will intensify. The administration argues that, in the event of rejection, the U.S.-led sanctions regime would unravel; the United States would be isolated as the spoiler; Iran would quickly build up its nuclear capabilities; and prospects for a military confrontation would increase. Opponents of the deal paint a much rosier scenario: The United States would build support for stronger sanctions; members of the international sanctions coalition would stick together in the hope of getting negotiations back on track, preventing confrontation, and avoiding the imposition of sanctions on their own firms; the Iranians would continue the interim freeze on their nuclear program; and before long, negotiations would resume and a better deal would be concluded.
Of course, we can only speculate on the consequences of rejection. But available evidence suggests that the likely outcome would be closer to the administration's predictions, although not quite as rapid or precarious.
Should Congress pass a joint resolution disapproving the nuclear deal and then override Obama's promised veto, the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act (INARA) would prevent the president from issuing the waivers needed to implement the U.S. commitment under the JCPOA to suspend U.S. sanctions-nullifying a central element of the deal and preemptively removing the incentive for Iran to begin implementing its nuclear commitments. Under the JCPOA, the suspension of U.S. sanctions is supposed to take place after Iran has fulfilled key nuclear commitments, most likely not until early 2016.
More immediately, congressional rejection would prevent the president from continuing to implement the limited sanctions relief required by the Joint Plan of Action (JPOA)-the interim agreement reached in November 2013.
One of the JPOA's relief measures has been to release $700 million to Iran each month of the roughly $100 billion of Iran's assets frozen in overseas accounts. Those payments would stop.
The most important of the JPOA's interim sanctions-relief measures involves the purchase of Iranian crude oil. Starting in 2012, U.S. oil sanctions compelled key countries purchasing Iranian crude to make significant cuts in their imports every six months. Under the JPOA, those countries were allowed to freeze reductions at already-reduced levels without risking sanctions. The end of JPOA sanctions relief under the INARA would mean that the administration would be required to impose sanctions on countries importing Iranian crude oil if they did not make significant additional reductions over the next six months. The countries that would be affected would include China, India, Japan, South Korea, and Turkey.
The key would be China, the largest purchaser of Iranian crude, which reluctantly made major cuts in imports to provide leverage for diplomacy. Convinced that the United States walked away from an effective solution to the nuclear problem, Beijing might simply ignore the re-imposition of U.S. oil sanctions and refuse to make further cuts, forcing the United States to choose between not imposing sanctions (and exposing them as a paper tiger) or imposing them and risking a major confrontation with China. And even if the U.S. chose the more confrontational course, China could possibly find workarounds, creating new banks and companies to bear the brunt of sanctions for facilitating oil purchases, while insulating major Chinese entities from the reach of U.S. sanctions and proceeding to increase purchases.
A less likely possibility is that the Chinese, wishing to avoid a confrontation with the United States and able to find alternative suppliers in today's well-supplied oil market, might decide to go along with the re-imposed sanctions. But instead of making the significant additional reductions required by U.S. sanctions law (roughly 20 percent additional cuts over six months), it might proffer a token reduction (e.g., a few percent), counting on the United States to regard that as sufficient not to trigger sanctions rather than precipitate a confrontation.
To avoid commercial disadvantage, India, Japan, and South Korea have been willing since 2012 to reduce crude oil purchases only as long as China was doing so. Following the rejection of the nuclear deal, they could be expected to follow Beijing's lead, either making token reductions of their own or ignoring the re-imposition of sanctions in the expectation that Washington would not pick a major fight with a united front of regional powers and trading partners.
So, in the worst case, congressional rejection could thrust the United States into a damaging standoff, threatening and possibly imposing sanctions against the world's leading economies in the uncertain hope of forestalling a rapid hemorrhaging of oil sanctions. In the best case, the United States could win grudging support for token additional reductions. But the likelihood of persuading Iran's principal customers to accept dramatic new cuts in purchases-on a scale that could pressure Iran to make major concessions it has been unwilling to make under the devastating sanctions it has faced for years-is extremely small, especially when all those customers view the negotiated deal as reasonable and would resent Washington's decision to walk away from it.
Meanwhile, the United States would be trying to maintain existing sanctions in areas other than crude oil. It would be assisted in this effort by the cautious approach many entities could be expected to take when considering whether to buck the current sanctions regime. Major international banks might be especially guarded, fearing a cutoff from the U.S. financial system if they ran afoul of U.S. sanctions.
But the temptation to enter or re-enter the Iranian market may, in many cases, override that caution. In anticipation of a nuclear agreement and the removal of sanctions, businesses all over the world, supported by their governments, have been eager to establish or restore commercial relationships with Iran and work on new deals. Sensing major opportunities, they want to move quickly, lest they wait too long and find themselves at a disadvantage relative to their competitors. A U.S. rejection of the nuclear deal and the indefinite continuation of American sanctions would give many of them pause. But we could expect others to begin testing whether existing U.S. sanctions would be vigorously enforced.
Until now, the United States has had the strong support of the European Union and European governments in enforcing sanctions. But in the wake of U.S. rejection of an agreement that European governments strongly support, European authorities may be less resolute in cracking down on sanctions evaders.
In an effort to hold the line on existing sanctions, the United States would need to pursue a vigorous worldwide campaign to penalize sanctions busters, threatening and imposing sanctions even on close allies and trading partners. And as the ranks of sanctions evaders grew and as the defectors came to believe there was strength in numbers, such a campaign could become increasingly confrontational, futile, and self-defeating, especially if the sanctioned entities had substantial economic links to the United States.
Existing sanctions would not collapse suddenly. But over time-perhaps a period of several months to a year-they would certainly erode. And if keeping the current sanctions regime intact would be very difficult, persuading the international community to ratchet up sanctions dramatically-what critics of the JCPOA are counting on to pressure Iran to accept a "better deal"-would be nearly impossible, especially in the absence of a major new provocation by Iran, such as a rapid increase in its enrichment capacity.
How would the Iranians react to congressional rejection of the JCPOA and U.S. efforts to strengthen sanctions? Some engagement-minded Iranians might recommend taking the "high road"-let the Americans shoot themselves in the foot; maintain the interim accord's nuclear freeze and enhanced monitoring measures without initiating the nuclear and monitoring steps required by the final deal; launch a worldwide campaign to blame the United States for the collapse of the diplomatic effort; and plan for increasing nuclear capacity at a time when Iran would escape any criticism for doing so.
However, such an Iranian reaction is very unlikely. With the United States resuming sanctions that had been suspended during the negotiations and the U.S. president legally barred from implementing the comprehensive sanctions relief that was Iran's main reason for reaching the nuclear deal, there is little chance of Tehran opting for the high road. Spurred on by domestic opponents of the nuclear deal, the supreme leader could be expected to retaliate against congressional action by forbidding steps to implement the JCPOA and authorizing the resumption of nuclear activities suspended under the JPOA.
To win over international opinion and encourage the erosion of international sanctions, Iran might initially see advantage in only a gradual increase in nuclear activities-testing advanced centrifuges but not increasing the number of operating centrifuges, resuming the construction of the originally designed Arak reactor, suspending the conversion of enriched uranium hexafluoride to oxide, discontinuing the JPOA's enhanced monitoring measures, and so on.
However, as time passed and the Iranians saw the United States actively seeking to retain and expand sanctions, nuclear self-restraint would become less and less politically tenable and Iran's nuclear capabilities would grow. Even then, the Iranians might well be reluctant to boost their capabilities at a rate that would cause alarm and provide a justification for new sanctions or the consideration of military options.
Congressional rejection of the JCPOA would mean the end of negotiations for quite some time. With the U.S. pursuing stronger sanctions and the Iranians increasing their nuclear capabilities, and each side accusing the other of bad faith, the climate for resuming diplomacy would deteriorate. Movement toward a military confrontation would not be inevitable-it would depend significantly on the pace and direction of Iran's nuclear program.
It is not inconceivable that a new round of negotiations could begin at some future date. But prospects for success would be more remote than at present. Iranian opponents of negotiations would have the convenient and domestically powerful argument that Iranian concessions make little sense when the Americans have demonstrated that they cannot be trusted to live up to their end of any deal. And by the time new negotiations got underway, both the scale and technical sophistication of Iran's nuclear program would be significantly greater than they are today.
Achieving a deal that would be as strong a barrier to a nuclear-armed Iran as the one currently on the table, especially without the powerful sanctions leverage that made the JCPOA possible, would be next to impossible. A "better deal"-now or in the future-is an illusion.
Go back to battleground issues list " Conclusion: An imperfect but worthy deal
The preceding discussion has focused on battleground issues related to the nuclear deal. Of course, congressional debate and voting will not be based exclusively, or even primarily, on the merits and shortcomings of the deal itself. For many members of Congress and the American public at large, the particulars of the JCPOA may be less important than questions surrounding the deal: Can we trust the Iranians? Will the deal moderate Iranian regional behavior or empower them to expand their destabilizing activities? Will it affect the internal political balance in Iran between pragmatists and ideologues, strengthen or jeopardize the security of traditional U.S. friends in the region, signal a decline in America's regional role or lead to a reassertion of U.S. leadership?
These are all crucial questions that need to be thoroughly debated. They should and will have an important bearing on any congressional vote. But the threshold test for the nuclear deal is whether it achieves its essential goal of preventing Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons. And to evaluate whether the JCPOA passes this critical test, the issues dealt with here must be well understood.
Any discussion of these battleground issues exposes some of the deal's imperfections. This is not surprising. Elements of the deal widely seen as positive do not become battleground issues. The negotiating outcomes that attract the most criticism and attention are those where difficult compromises have been made. As the deal's supporters would acknowledge, it would have been better for restrictions on enrichment capacity to last longer, for Iran to disclose the details and true purpose of its past activities, for inspections to be carried out without advanced notification, for constraints on conventional arms and ballistic missiles to be accepted as binding by Iran and to last indefinitely, and for restricted assets to be released gradually over time. Unfortunately, these and other ideal outcomes were not achievable.
However, such ideal but unrealizable outcomes are not necessary to achieve an acceptable agreement. The questions and concerns raised by the battleground issues can be addressed by U.S. policies that supplement the deal and bolster its overall effectiveness. None of these policies are constrained by the JCPOA.
To address concerns about Iran reaching threshold nuclear status in the out years, the United States should adopt a firm public policy aimed at deterring a future Iranian decision to cross the threshold and build nuclear weapons. With the endorsement of Congress, U.S. presidents should declare that the United States will use any means necessary, including military force, to prevent Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons. In that connection, the United States should identify privately to Tehran activities that have no plausible peaceful justification in Iran and would be regarded as evidence that Iran had decided to pursue nuclear weapons (e.g., production of highly enriched uranium or separated plutonium).
In the event of unresolved issues regarding the possible military dimensions of past Iranian activities, the United States should make detection of any future Iranian weaponization activities a high priority for U.S. intelligence; enforce strictly JCPOA restrictions on Iranian procurement of weaponization-related equipment; and encourage the IAEA to remain focused on the weaponization issue as it implements the Additional Protocol in Iran and develops its "broader conclusion" on the nature of Iran's nuclear program that will provide the basis for a future congressional decision on terminating U.S. nuclear-related statutory sanctions.
To avert Tehran's exploitation of the time allotted for IAEA inspections, the United States should press for the most expeditious implementation of the JCPOA's access procedures; share intelligence with the IAEA and its Joint Commission partners on suspect activities and on possible efforts by Iran to sanitize suspect sites; and be prepared to go directly to the U.N. Security Council, without waiting for IAEA access, when warranted by the seriousness and time-urgency of illicit Iranian activities.
The United States should take a number of steps to reinforce restrictions on conventional arms and ballistic missiles: ◦ Press potential supplier governments to comply with renewed Security Council prohibitions on transferring major conventional weapons and missile technology to Iran; ◦ Step up U.N.-authorized efforts to interdict illicit shipments to and from Iran; ◦ Strengthen the conventional military and missile defense capabilities of U.S. regional partners (with congressional approval of proposed arms sales to the Gulf Arabs and a new 10-year military assistance MOU with Israel); and ◦ When U.N. restrictions expire after five and eight years, use other available legal authorities and policy tools-including U.N. embargoes on transfers to certain non-state actors and U.S. sanctions laws-to impede Iran's conventional and missile capabilities and support for its proxies.
To strengthen international backing for the snap-back of sanctions in the event of Iranian violations, the United States should actively build support at the outset for rigorous enforcement of compliance (including with respect to minor violations); ensure a common understanding among the P5+1 and other key states regarding JCPOA provisions dealing with sanctions relief and snap-back; and work with those partners to establish procedures and contingency plans for the re-imposition of sanctions and adoption of other penalties, including appropriate responses to both small and major infractions.
To address concerns about Iran's use of the funds released from restricted overseas accounts, the United States, working with its regional partners, should closely monitor and be prepared to counter Iranian efforts to arm, train, and fund its proxies throughout the Middle East. While the United States and its partners should welcome any genuine Iranian interest in resolving disputes diplomatically, they should remain vigilant against further Iranian efforts to destabilize the region and should mobilize their collective economic resources and military capabilities in a coordinated strategy to thwart any such efforts. A strong U.S. commitment to remain engaged militarily and politically in the region will be indispensable in re-building the region's confidence in U.S. leadership and in reassuring our partners that the nuclear deal will not adversely affect their interests. 
Any negotiated agreement involves compromises and, from the perspective of one party or another, shortcomings. The real and imagined shortcomings of the JCPOA will be on full display as Congress debates the battleground issues and eventually votes on the deal. But despite its imperfections, a careful review indicates that the JCPOA, especially if supplemented and bolstered by the kind of U.S. policies suggested here, will prevent Iran from becoming a nuclear-armed state for the foreseeable future and serve the security interests of the United States and its regional partners. On that basis, it is worthy of support by Congress and the American public.

For much of this summer, Washington has indulged in a vitriolic debate regarding the Iran deal, but all this cacophony should not obscure the very unsettling discussion of the deal that is taking place inside Iran. Since the announcement of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), Iranian officials have stressed their commitment to industrialize their nuclear program, insisted the accord can be violated on the margins with impunity and that none of their military installations will be inspected.
While contentious in America, the agreement has been greeted with triumphalist rhetoric in Iran. President Hasan Rouhani noted last week, "There is no one in the world today to say that Iran went into a war with the six great powers of the world and was not successful." The notion that Iran compelled the United States to acknowledge its right to enrich and abandoned its long standing prohibitions has been echoed from a variety of platforms. Some of this rhetoric may be a means of justifying a deal that after all does impose some curbs on Iran's nuclear trajectory, but the sum total of the summer's discourse inside Iran reflects a regime satisfied with its diplomatic achievement.
Across the political spectrum, Iran's elite are united is seeing this deal as a prelude to the further development of their nuclear infrastructure. Through much of its existence, Iran's nuclear program was an illicit one, subject to sanctions and sabotage. The threat of military attack hovered over the program, threatening its progress if not existence. The fact is that Iran required time to develop a state-of-the-art infrastructure and dispose of its antiquated devices. A deal that legalizes the program, shields it from retribution and grants it a reliable procurement channel for obtaining technologies from abroad is what Iran needed to construct an industrial nuclear network. Before the JCPOA, Iran was the custodian of an embryonic nuclear program that nearly all of the Western intelligence services were seeking to derail. All that is now gone.
The expansion of Iran's program is certainly on the mind of Ali Akbar Salehi, the head of Iran's Atomic Energy Organization, who now contemplates a scientific cadre of 20,000 nuclear engineers working in multiple nuclear complexes. Among the technologies that Iran pledges to modernize is its primitive stock of IR-1 centrifuges that are a poor instruments for bomb making. Iran's technicians have long eyed the more advanced IR-8 models that operate with much greater velocity and efficiency. As early as April, Abbas Araqchi, one of Iran s lead negotiators, stressed that Iran was not in a position to construct such machines given that their "research and development takes a long time and it will take 8 to 10 years to produce them in abundance." And this is precisely the schedule that Iran negotiated for bringing them on-line. Once Iran has reliable cascades of IR-8s then it has a sneak out capability for it takes very few such devices housed in a small installation that may escape detection to enrich weapon-grade uranium.
The inspection regime of the JCPOA that has been subject of so much contention in Washington is casually dismissed by Iran's leaders. General Muhammad Jaffari, the head of the Revolutionary Guards, has said that "any resolution that would be in contradiction to our country's redlines will have no validity." In a similar vein, General Ahmad Reza Purdastan, the commander of Iran's ground forces, has stressed, "We will by no means allow inspection of military centers and sites; whatever the deal is, it should be about nuclear technology, production and export."
All this places the recent controversy over the International Atomic Energy Agency's (IAEA) access to the Parchin base that is suspected to be at the heart of Iran's nuclear weapons program in an unsettling context. According to press reports, the IAEA inspectors will not have direct physical access to the base. The Obama administration and the IAEA have hid behind flimsy assertions of confidentiality and have refused to release the exact monitoring terms. Such claims of confidentiality certainly did not stop the IAEA in 2007 from publicly releasing the original work plan it negotiated with Iran that covers all areas of concern. Given that the Iran's leaders claim that none of their military facilities will be subject to direct inspections, the intriguing question that hovers over the JCPOA is whether the alleged Parchin deal applies to all of Iran's disputed installations. If so, this is hardly the gold-standard of verification that Obama persistently pledges.
Beyond the verification system, the notion that the JCPOA can be enforced in all incidences has generated its own share of claims. In his presentation of the agreement to the parliament, Foreign Minister Javad Zarif assured the deputies that "the sanctions can be re-imposed on Iran only in case of serious violation of its obligations and not in case of small-scale violations." The history of arms control certainly affirms Zarif's judgment, since the international community often becomes so invested in the perpetuation of any agreement that it ignores technical breaches. The problem is that overtime the cumulative impact of incremental violations can be quite substantial.
As Washington descents into its heated debate, its Islamist adversary seems at ease with an accord that meets all of its essential technological imperatives. Today, Iran is in command of a legitimized nuclear program that in few years, with this deal, will be on a cusp of a remarkable surge.
Ray Takeyh is Senior Fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations. 
A curious defense of the Iran deal is emerging. Some Democrats say that if the agreement is implemented, they will resist nefarious Iranian policies, domestic abuses, human rights repression, and sponsorship of terrorism. In a speech Wednesday, Hillary Clinton pledged that as president, " I will raise the costs for their actions and confront them across the board." But these muscular declarations often lack specifics, which makes them appear more as justifications for this accord's deficiencies than blueprints for a different policy.
No amount of U.S. military deployments or arms sales can ameliorate the consequences of a flawed arms-control agreement. How would additional U.S. naval vessels in the Persian Gulf address the fact that, under the deal, in eight years Iran could begin operating centrifuges that could give it a capability to break out toward a weapon? How would additional missile defense systems for Israel address the fact that when the nuclear deal expires, Iran would be free to accumulate as much uranium it wishes at whatever enrichment gradations it can justify for nonmilitary uses? How would the sale of additional aircraft to Saudi Arabia improve a verification mechanism that relies on a protracted time table, endless mediation, and physical inspections that might be inhibited?
The biggest problem with the Iran nuclear deal boils down to the provisions of the deal itself. Still, a true policy of pushing back against Iran requires a type of activism increasingly abjured in progressive policy circles. Namely, it would involve reversing Iran's gains in Iraq. And that would require not just material assistance but also additional U.S. troops. The dismal shape of Iraqi security forces necessitates U.S. advisers and trainers on a large scale. And so far, those Democrats stressing their determination to contain Iran have ignored its imprint in Iraq.
Can a policy of pushing back against Iran be taken seriously if it does not involve changing the balance of power in Syria's civil war? The ouster of Bashar al-Assad, a dependable Iranian client, would require organizing Syria's opposition forces into a cohesive fighting group, solidifying their gains with U.S. assistance (this might take the form of airpower), and perhaps deploying Special Forces. Dislodging Iran's grip on its Mediterranean outpost would require a sustained U.S. commitment involving funds and forces. So far, no Democratic senator, House member, or presidential candidate pledging a robust Iran policy has outlined a credible plan for achieving their goals.
How does the United States seek to prevent Iranian mischief in the Gulf? Mrs. Clinton said Wednesday that as president she would reaffirm that the Persian Gulf-in particular the Strait of Hormuz-is a region of "vital interest" to the U.S. and would bolster security cooperation with Gulf allies. This is reminiscent of the Carter Doctrine, the declaration by Jimmy Carter that the U.S. would use force if needed to defend its national interests in the Gulf. Recall that the Iranians treated President Carter's professions of bellicosity with utmost seriousness. Still, Iran does not invade countries; it subverts them. Negation of that requires systematic internal reforms addressing issues such as youth unemployment, institutional decay, and a closed political system. The absence of this much-delayed conversation augurs poorly for regional stability in the future.
Many proponents of the nuclear deal have said they will focus on the much-neglected issue of human rights in Iran. The regime in Tehran represses and unrelentingly abuses citizens. "We will enforce, and if need be, broaden our human rights sanctions," Mrs. Clinton said. As part of the agreement parameters announced this summer, all sanctions against Iran's central bank have been lifted. Are Mrs. Clinton and others who say that Iranian lives matter prepared to reverse this and reimpose sanctions against the bank? If not, their approach to human rights abuses in Iran looks decidedly less serious.
There is an  inherent contradiction in striking an arms-control agreement with Iran, and this accord's shortcomings are legion. It is difficult to address the deal's shortcomings without adjusting its key provisions. But the pledges offered so far appear more like hazy declarations than real plans.

With the recent announcement by Sen. Barbara Mikulski (D-Md.) that she would support the Iran nuclear deal, formally known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), President Obama secured the support of enough senators to ensure that Congress could not block the agreement from taking effect. Opponents of the deal have lost, principally because they have been unable to demonstrate that any viable alternatives exist to rein in Iran's nuclear capability as effectively. So is the battle on Capitol Hill over?
Hardly. Hoping to cause the deal's failure, members of Congress who object to the JCPOA are already proposing that Congress pass new sanctions tied to Iran's support for terrorism. They could very well succeed in such an effort. While a two-thirds majority would be needed in both chambers to pass a resolution that would block the deal over a promised presidential veto, only a simple majority in the House and 60 votes in the Senate (to overcome a filibuster) would be needed to impose sanctions through new legislation. (The president might very well veto new sanctions as well, which would require a two-thirds majority to override; however, Congress could make it painful for the president to cast a veto by, for example, including new sanctions in must-pass legislation like a Continuing Resolution that prevents a government shutdown.)
Iran would object mightily to a bait-and-switch in which the United States relaxes nuclear-related sanctions under the JCPOA, but reimposes them separately as punishment for other Iranian behavior. Such a move would almost certainly drive Iran to pull out of the deal, arguing that Washington failed to hold up its end of the bargain. Indeed, earlier this week, Iran's Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, declared that Iran would withdraw from the agreement if the West failed to lift sanctions, as promised. It is safe to assume Tehran would do the same, Treasury Secretary Jack Lew warned lawmakers, if the United States were to "just reimpose the nuclear sanctions with a new label."
Furthermore, U.S. allies and partners would view the imposition of new sanctions just as skeptically. In a briefing to Congress in early August, senior European diplomats asserted that their nations would relax sanctions even if Congress rejected the JCPOA - thereby giving Iran the economic benefits it has sought even if, in the absence of a deal, Tehran would not need to submit its nuclear program to intensive monitoring. Presumably, these nations would give Iran the same economic relief if Congress failed to block the deal, but then imposed new sanctions. Such a result would be a win-win for Iran and a lose-lose for the United States.
As a result it seems that the most constructive role for Congress at this point would be to engage in rigorous, careful oversight of the deal's implementation rather than to try to derail it through further legislation. Committees with jurisdiction over relevant issues - principally those responsible for foreign affairs, defense, and intelligence - could demand frequent briefings from the administration and hold regular hearings to ensure that Iran is following through on its commitments. Committees could hold classified hearings in which the executive branch reports sensitive details regarding Iran's nuclear program and open hearings in which administration officials could be held publicly accountable for any shortcomings in implementation. Congress could also pass legislation requiring the executive branch to provide regular, detailed reports - both classified and unclassified - on Iranian compliance. By gathering information about the deal's execution over time, Congress could make credible determinations regarding its effectiveness and develop legislation that is informed by facts.
The JCPOA is a multilateral agreement, having been signed by Germany, the United Kingdom, France, China, and Russia, as well as the United States and Iran. Enforcement of the agreement will be a multilateral task as well. Members of Congress should therefore travel widely to hear different perspectives on the deal and to share their own views with these partners and with the International Atomic Energy Agency, which will play a key role in verifying Iran's implementation of the deal. Many members of Congress deride international "fact-finding" trips as boondoggles that waste taxpayer's money, but Congress cannot expect to understand whether a complex international agreement is being effectively executed without getting out to the field and hearing from those involved in its implementation.
If the JCPOA indeed prevents Iran from developing a nuclear weapon for the next 15 years or more, it will enhance the security of U.S. allies as much as it does that of the United States. Nevertheless, Congress could consider ways to further promote the security of key partners such as Israel and Saudi Arabia. Obama has proposed providing Saudi Arabia a $1 billion weapons package to bolster its defense against Iranian aggression, and he has offered Israel additional intelligence and security assistance that would allow it to better counter Lebanese Hezbollah, which Iran supports. Congress should consider providing funds for such regional security initiatives.
Most discussions of how Congress could react to the JCPOA focus on how it could force Iranian compliance by utilizing negative incentives, such as additional sanctions or the threat of force. However, Congress could also encourage Iran to adhere to the deal by holding out the prospect of future rewards. The JCPOA does not call for the lifting of statutory sanctions that prevent U.S. companies from doing business in or with Iran. But Congress could hold hearings to examine what level of Iranian compliance with the JCPOA might, at some point, justify the lifting of these prohibitions. Such hearings could dangle the prospect of future economic relations with the United States in front of the Iranian government, providing an alluring reward for full implementation of the JCPOA that would have the side benefit of creating jobs and generating profits in the United States as well.
Congressional opponents of the agreement with Iran have so far focused on how they could derail it. That battle is over. If their goal is Iranian compliance, Congress should now allow the JCPOA to go forward, monitor its implementation carefully, and then respond to Iranian behavior with further incentives that reward Tehran for complying or penalties that punish it for failing to do so. To continue working ceaselessly to undermine the deal at this point works against that goal since it would undermine the credibility of the United States and - because other countries will relax sanctions regardless of what Washington does - give Iran the opportunity to reap economic benefits while continuing its nuclear program. Legislators have a continuing role to play, but if Iran's compliance is Congress's goal, the most effective move is to stop trying to kill the agreement and focus instead on ensuring that it is effectively implemented.
Larry Hanauer is a senior international policy analyst at the nonprofit, nonpartisan RAND Corporation. He is the author of the recent report,  The Days After a Deal with Iran: Congress's Role in Implementing a Nuclear Agreement.
Several people (including Senator Cruz, Eugene Kontorovich, Mike Pompeo and David Rivkin, and a majority of the members of the House of Representatives) have argued that the Iran Review Act bars the President from lifting U.S. sanctions against Iran.  This argument is stronger than I first thought.  But I think it ultimately fails.  Below I set forth the arguments as I see them and sketch some of the legal and practical hurdles to their ultimate success.  (This is my first run at this issue; the arguments are surely more complex than even my complex and lengthy presentation here suggests.)
1.         Does the President Have a Statutory Duty to Transmit the IAEA Side Deals?
Section (a) of the Iran Review Act requires the President to "transmit to the appropriate congressional committees and leadership ... the agreement [with Iran], as defined in subsection (h)(1), including all related materials and annexes."  Subsection (h)(1), in turn, provides:
The term 'agreement' means an agreement related to the nuclear program of Iran that includes the United States, commits the United States to take action, or pursuant to which the United States commits or otherwise agrees to take action, regardless of the form it takes, whether a political commitment or otherwise, and regardless of whether it is legally binding or not, including any joint comprehensive plan of action entered into or made between Iran and any other parties, and any additional materials related thereto, including annexes, appendices, codicils, side agreements, implementing materials, documents, and guidance, technical or other understandings, and any related agreements, whether entered into or implemented prior to the agreement or to be entered into or implemented in the future.
This definition includes the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA, the main deal) plus "any additional materials related thereto, including ... side agreements."  At first glance the definition appears to include the side-deals between the IAEA and Iran that concern verification of the JCPOA and military dimensions of Iran's nuclear weapons program.  These deals are side-agreements to the JCPOA, and they clearly relate to it.  However, as Rob Howse notes, the definition is limited at the beginning of Subsection (h)(1) to an agreement that "includes the United States, commits the United States to take action, or pursuant to which the United States commits or otherwise agrees to take action."  The IAEA side deals with Iran are not ones that include the United States or that commit it to take action. Thus, Howse concludes, the President has no duty to transmit them.
That is a convincing point as far as it goes.  But there is a different argument for requiring the President to transmit the IAEA side deals that I have not yet seen made and that avoids the Howse rejoinder.  That argument is that subsection (h)(1) (including the limiting definition that Howse notes) applies to and defines only the term "agreement" in Section (a).  The clause in Section (a) that is set off by commas suggests that the definition in (h)(1) interprets only the term "agreement," and that the phrase "all related materials and annexes" forms a separate part of the President's obligation under Section (a) that is not specifically defined in subsection (h)(1).  (If the definition in (h)(1) were meant to apply to "related materials and annexes," it would read: "the agreement, including all related materials and annexes, as defined in subsection (h)(1).")  I thus think it is at least plausible to read Section (a) to mean that the President must disclose the agreement and related materials that commit the United States, plus all related materials and annexes beyond the ones that commit the United States, which might include the IAEA side agreements.  Congress might well have wanted to define the agreement that commits the United States very broadly (as the definition does) but also include the undefined "related materials and annexes" beyond the ones that commit the United States in the President's duty to transmit.    
Complicating this reasoning, however, is the term "including" in Section (a).  This term most naturally suggests that the "related materials and annexes" form a subset of the defined term "agreement," which would exclude the side deals because they do not commit the United States.  This appears to be the sense in which "including" is used in at least many other parts of the Review Act.  The main problem with this reading of "including" in Section (a), however, is that it makes the phrase "related materials and annexes" redundant, since the term "agreement" is defined to include related materials and annexes.  Interpretations that render statutory words superfluous are (all things equal) disfavored.  By contrast to the inclusive sense of "including," one could read "including" to be additive in the sense of making the related materials and annexes (beyond the agreement and related materials that concern the U.S. commitment) part of the President's obligation to transmit.  This reading has the virtue of avoiding the redundancy and giving independent meaning to the words "related materials and annexes."  But while it is an acceptable interpretation of "including," it is not the favored one, I think.    
For all of these reasons, I think there is a plausible but not obviously winning argument that the plain terms of the Review Act require the President to transmit the IAEA side deals to Congress.  The President claims that he does not possess the side deals to disclose.  That makes it hard for him to comply with the statute, and impossible to comply if he has no chance of obtaining the side deals.  But such an impossibility now should not by itself affect the best reading of what Congress demanded in May when it enacted the Iran Review Act.  (It might, however, affect how courts view the matter, as I discuss below.)
2.         The Consequences of the President's Failure to Transmit the IAEA Side Deals
A decent but again not clinching case can be made that the consequence of failure to transmit the side IAEA deals is that the President cannot yet lift the Iran sanctions.  
Section (b)(3) of the Act provides:  " Prior to and during the period for transmission of an agreement in subsection (a)(1), ... the President may not waive, suspend, reduce, provide relief from, or otherwise limit the application of statutory sanctions with respect to Iran under any provision of law or refrain from applying any such sanctions pursuant to an agreement described in subsection (a)."  The argument against the President is that because he has not yet transmitted the (entire) agreement (i.e. the IAEA side deals) to Congress, the review period has not begun to run and the President thus "may not waive," etc., the statutory sanctions against Iran.  
The argument is not airtight.  It depends on whether we are still "prior to and during the period for transmission of the agreement."  The plain text of the Review Act suggests that we are beyond that period because the President had a duty to under Section (a) to transmit the agreement and all related materials and annexes within five days after the agreement was reached.  The time frame prior to and during the period for transmission began and ended in July.  Thus, the argument for the President goes, the sixty-day clock for Congress's review period began to run in July (just as Congress appeared to assume at the time and until very recently).   The counterargument is that the President cannot be relieved of the statutory ban on lifting sanctions by defying the deadline for submitting the agreement.  No one would accept that the President could have avoided the statutory duty to maintain sanctions by simply not submitting the JCPOA; the same reasoning applies to the side agreements if they are "related materials" under Section (a).  This argument, however, lacks an obvious textual basis, and one might think that if Congress gets the advantage of the plain text for the argument about the President's duty to transmit, it must suffer the disadvantage of the plain text for the consequences of the President's failure to transmit.  Also cutting against the argument that the review period has not yet begun to run is the fact that until very recently Congress acted as if the period of review had begun to run.   
I am sure there are other arguments for and against both the President's duty to transmit the IAEA side agreements and the President's authority to waive sanctions if he failed to satisfy a statutory duty to transmit.  But let's assume that the argument against the President succeeds to the extent that a plausible textual case has been made that the Iran Review Act prohibits the President from waiving the sanctions because he has not yet submitted materials related to the agreement and thus the period of congressional review has not yet started to run.  What then?    
There is talk of Congress suing the President.  But in litigation, Congress faces many hurdles to success beyond what a naked reading of the statute suggests.
Standing.  Eugene Kontorovich covered this issue last week.  I am more skeptical than he is about Congress's standing to sue the President over his arguable failure to follow the law.  I doubt that what happened here rises to the level of "vote nullification" required by Raines v. Byrd, though the case for standing would be strengthened if one or both of the chambers of Congress authorizes the suit.  I disagree with Eugene that the recent decision in House of Representatives v. Burwell helps here.  There the court recognized congressional standing to redress a clear presidential usurpation of Congress's constituional power over the purse .  But it held that the House lacked standing to argue (as would be the case in Review Act litigation) that the President has misinterpreted or disregarded the law in execution.  As the court said:
If [such an argument] were accepted, every instance of an extra-statutory action by an Executive officer might constitute a cognizable constitutional violation, redressable by Congress through a lawsuit.  Such a conclusion would contradict decades of administrative law and precedent, in which courts have guarded against "the specter of 'general legislative standing' based upon claims that the Executive Branch is misinterpreting a statute or the Constitution."
While I don't think Congress will have standing, I agree with Eugene that if a State is sued over its continuing sanctions against Iran, the merits of the President's waiver might be litigated.  But many powerful theories of preemption would be in play against the State arguments.
Article II.  If the litigation reaches the merits the President will likely make a number of constitutional arguments about Congress intruding on his Article II powers.  One argument might be that the requirement that he submit the side deal is unconstitutional because the President cannot be forced to submit sensitive information that he believes would jeopardize national security.  Last month the Justice Department released a 2003 OLC memo that made an argument of this sort in the similar context of not providing Congress with information related to WMD.  The argument in the memo is a full-throated defense of presidential prerogative that was typical of the period, but a form of the argument has a pedigree that goes back through recent administrations, back to the Iran Contra imbroglio, and back yet further as to Washington's refusal to turn over information about the Jay treaty to the House of representatives.  (Marcy Wheeler first noted the connection between the OLC memo and the Iran matter.) 
I expect that the administration would argue that the requirement to turn over a secret side deal that it did not negotiate or possess but that is crucial to the success of an important nuclear arms control agreement is unconstitutional.  At a minimum, and more likely, I think it would argue that the possibility of unconstitutionality is a reason not to read the (ambiguous) statute to demand such information.  Relatedly, it might also argue (relying on arguments found in OLC opinions like this one) that the congressional demand for information related to the agreement that the President does not possess unconstitutionally compels the President to engage in diplomatic activity to, among other things, seek and obtain the agreement.  I expect it would also argue, at least under constitutional avoidance, that reading the Review Act to require transmission of the IAEA side deals would (in the words of Zivotofsky II) constitute a "congressional command [that] would ... prevent the Nation from speaking with one voice [and] also prevent the Executive itself from doing so in conducting foreign relations." 
I lack time now assess these arguments on the merits.  But I do think that arguments of this sort will have special salience-less perhaps for their legal merits than as reasons that judges might latch on to in order to avoid ruling against the President in this very high stakes diplomatic context.  Cf. Zivotofsky II.  Which leads to the final point ... 
Deference, De Jure and De Facto.  If the case reaches the merits the President will argue for deference in the matter - in interpreting the statute, and in assessing the impact of a presidential loss on foreign relations.  Much more important than the formal legal arguments for deference is that it is highly unlikely that a court, especially an appellate court, and almost certainly the Supreme Court, is going to find the statutory arguments here compelling enough to issue an injunction (or some other form of relief) that would prevent the President from waiving sanctions and thus possibly blow up the Iran Deal.  The courts are not, on the basis of the statutory arguments sketched above, going to unwind the Iran Deal that Congress could not unwind on its own, especially since Congress acted for so long as if the review period had been triggered.  Whether courts get to that conclusion through statutory interpretation (including constitutional avoidance and executive deference) or through standing or some other justiciability gambit, they will get there.  Of that I am more confident than anything I have said to this point. 
PS: I cannot resist a friendly poke at Andy McCarthy, who was a critic of the Iran Review Act (and before that an opponent of congressional restrictions on presidential waivers of sanctions), but who is now a champion of the argument that the Iran Review Act bars the President from waiving sanctions.  Andy continues to claim that the JCPOA's opponents would have been better off without the Review Act.  But the clear fact is that without the Act, Obama would have ignored Congress altogether and already exercised his preexisting statutory authority to lift the Iran sanctions.  (As I have explained before, the idea that the Congress or Senate could have forced the President to submit the JCPOA for approval as a treaty or congressional-executive agreement is a fantasy.)  In any event, I am glad that Andy is now supportive, at least in part, of the Iran Review Act, which I doubt will stop the President from lifting sanctions, but which has forced the President to disclose a lot, which has sparked very important public deliberation, and which has resulted in members of Congress being on record and accountable for the subsequent success or failure of the JCPOA.   
The promise of sanctions relief helped bring Iran to negotiate over its nuclear program, yielding an accord due to be implemented in the coming months. Some members of the U.S. Congress are now calling for tightening sanctions linked to Iran's regional and domestic behavior, but a number of experts say this could drive Iran to abandon its nuclear commitments. As the White House and Congress consider next steps, "what is required is prudence," says Richard Nephew, director of the Economic Statecraft, Sanctions, and Energy Markets program at Columbia University's School of International and Public Affairs. Nephew, a former sanctions official at the U.S. State Department, says it will be important to balance the needs of ensuring a deal aimed at curbing Iran's nuclear program with concerns about how to restrain Iran's actions in the region.

Under the terms of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) inked by Iran and major powers, Iran is expected to take steps to restrict its nuclear program before it receives sanctions relief. What major sanctions should we expect to see lifted when the IAEA had verified Iran's compliance?Debate in Washington has turned to expanding existing nonnuclear sanctions, and perhaps imposing new ones, related to support for terrorism, destabilizing the region, missile proliferation, and human rights. What might those sanctions entail, and how will they be perceived by Tehran?It will basically be all those sanctions that govern foreign trade with Iran. This covers the oil and gas sector, as well as financial, transportation, and other associated services. Ninety-five percent of [Iran's] external economic activity will be covered by the sanctions relief.
There are important exceptions. Particular banks, for instance, will still be on [U.S.] sanctions lists, and some types of trade-for instance, with items that could be used in nuclear programs, but may not necessarily be-will also still be covered. Of course, the U.S. primary embargo involving all of those different things will remain fully in place.
"If the United States tries to sanction the entirety of the Iranian financial system all over again using the excuse of terrorism, the Iranians will walk away."
These nonnuclear sanctions have been enforced vigorously throughout the [interim] Joint Plan of Action, and the nonnuclear sanctions architecture has not only been preserved under the negotiations; it's been enhanced. The Treasury Department, intelligence community, and State Department will keep looking for evidence of bad Iranian behavior, based on what's presently in law. If you're supporting Hezbollah, Hamas, the Houthis in Yemen, or [Syrian President Bashar al-] Assad, and you're an Iranian, you are potentially subject to sanctions. If you are a facilitator of Iranian support for those bad actors, you are potentially subject to sanctions. That will continue across the fronts of human rights, terrorism, ballistic-missile proliferation. If you do business with Iranians who have been found to support terrorism, you're potentially subject to sanctions.
If you are a bank in Europe and you do business transactions on behalf of the Iran Revolutionary Guard Corps, even if the EU delists the IRGC, U.S. sanctions will still mean that those banks that do that business are potentially courting penalties. That includes being cut off from the U.S. [financial system].
There is some interest in looking at where there will be potential gaps once UN arms embargo restrictions lapse [in five years], as well as the ballistic-missile-related restrictions [in eight years]. There could be efforts to impose sanctions on any transfer of conventional arms to or from Iran that wouldn't otherwise be captured by the UN embargo.
When the UN arms and ballistic-missile embargoes lapse, could unilateral U.S. measures be as effective as multilateral measures they'd be replacing?The Iranians have as much interest in the nuclear deal being sustained as the United States, so I doubt that for one additional Iranian bank or one additional IRGC person being sanctioned they're going to walk away from the deal. But if the United States tries to sanction the entirety of the Iranian financial system all over again using the excuse of terrorism, the Iranians will walk away.
What is required is prudence-to decide whether the penalties that would be imposed on Iranian bad actors are significant enough that it could stop their bad activity or impair their bad activity and that it's worth risking a possible negative Iranian response. If we see Iranian bad actors doing things in violation of U.S. law, we ought to consider sanctioning them, even more so if we think our sanctions will have a positive impact. But if we're just looking for ways to look tough, that's a bad reason to take new measures.
You've raised the possibility that Iran's economy could remain stagnant for years to come-whether a residual effect of sanctions or because of unrelated structural problems-and President Hassan Rouhani's promise of an economic dividend from the nuclear accord will ring hollow. Could that jeopardize the agreement? We're all supposed to abide by the terms of UN Security Council resolutions. But let's be blunt: the UN arms embargo has not stopped the Iranians from exporting arms to Assad, Hamas, and the Taliban, or from supporting the Houthis.
Will the risk of sanctions snap back or uncertainty about U.S. intentions keep firms out of Iran?U.S. sanctions have been helpful in ensuring that if violations of the UN arms embargo are detected, a penalty can be imposed. There's no veto that can block imposition of U.S. sanctions with regard to arms transfers, whereas in the UN system, there is. Unilateral U.S. action can have more teeth than UN action, even if it doesn't have the imprimatur of UN support. The practical may always trump the rhetorical.
Absolutely. There will be tremendous political pressure on Rouhani to make good on the expectations that he's raised in his campaign rhetoric and what he's said while negotiating the deal. If the economy stalls out, even if the sanctions relief from the deal is working just fine, there will tremendous pressure on the government to explain itself.
On the U.S. side, do you foresee any legislative measures threatening implementation of the agreement?The easiest explanation that the Iranian government could come up with is "we struck a great deal, but sanctions-the West, those awful Great Satan Americans-have hindered our ability to advance ourselves, which was supposed to be part of the JCPOA." You could see competitors to Rouhani in the 2017 elections or beyond that say "you shouldn't reelect Rouhani because he hasn't delivered the goods, whereas I can-and I'll start by rejecting the nuclear deal."
The near-term risk of this kind of development is pretty low because everyone understands it'll take some time for the economy to rebound. But four or five years down the line, that argument won't work anymore.
A lot of companies will want to see that the deal is being implemented smoothly before they make major investments in Iran. That doesn't mean they won't do some quick-turnaround business that they could terminate quickly, but they'll be nervous about doing a lot of long-lasting stuff.
The United States and European Union maintain separate sanctions lists. Does that undermine their efficacy?The other factor is the U.S. political system. If we decide we're not going to fulfill our part of the deal, then the deal will fall apart and a lot of European and Asian companies will be at risk. When you have a U.S. presidential debate in which many of the Republican candidates say they're going to rip up the deal, a thoughtful European company is not going to make a major investment in Tehran until after we know who's going to be president and what their approach to Iran is really going to be.
Some people [in Washington] are talking about trying to reimpose the oil embargo [that is set to be lifted under the JCPOA] as a part of strangling the Iranian economy. Nothing will help the Iranians walk away from a deal faster than that. If the idea is to stop terrorism, people should look at recent history: The Iranians have been under tremendous economic pressure in large part because of oil sanctions and they haven't stopped their support for terrorism.
What sanctions lessons should policymakers take from the experience of negotiating the nuclear accord?Secondly, a lot of sanctions advocates say that we ought to make sure that there is a good-conduct test to let Iranian banks off designation lists. Iranian banks are not going to be able to pass that test; they're not going to provide assurances that they won't provide funding for IRGC-related companies, since they're a major part of the Iranian economy. The Iranian economy couldn't support that, and the Iranian government will walk away.
The third major category is the piecemeal approach-this new idea [in Washington] of trying to ratchet over time sanctions associated with terrorism and whatnot to reengineer what we already had [for nuclear nonproliferation]. A lot of this is focused on trying to sanction every company that's gotten near the IRGC. Again, that's profoundly dangerous in terms of what the Iranians would do.
This interview has been condensed and edited.Not yet; our sanctions lists are quite in sync. Over time, some people and entities will come off, notably the IRGC, as well as others that the Europeans sanctioned for nuclear reasons even if we have them sanctioned for terrorism reasons. That will be a problem, legally as well as politically, come eight to ten years from now, when the sanctions are supposed to come off in Europe.
The bigger problem is if we continue to have differences of view with Europe about what is terrorism and support for terrorism. For example, we have been designating and sanctioning Hezbollah for a long time. The European Union only imposed sanctions on Hezbollah in 2013, and even then, only on its military wing.
Some people want to keep sanctions on Iran in place forever in response to things that weren't part of the original discussion. We are going to undo our own global economic advantages and contribute to our inability to use sanctions in the future if we overuse them now.
That doesn't mean we shouldn't have tough sanctions on those we've defined as bad guys, but we ought to make sure that people understand we're not doing it capriciously. That's one risk I see in this Iran debate: A lot of people in the world think that we're sanctions-happy-and because we are not going to deal with the consequences of it [because U.S. firms face a general trade embargo with Iran] and their companies are, that there's no reason why we shouldn't be. Over time, that mindset will lead people to say, "why are we going to rely on the U.S. financial system?" Or, "we're going to diversify our business so we're not at risk in the United States." That is a dangerous implication for our economy and our ability to use sanctions.
When Aaron Stein was studying nuclear nonproliferation at Middlebury College's Monterey graduate program, the students would sometimes construct what they thought would be the best possible nuclear inspection and monitoring regimes. 
Years later, Stein is now a Middle East and nuclear proliferation expert with the Royal United Services Institute (as well as the Geneva Centre for Security Policy and the Atlantic Council) . And in April, he told me that the Iran nuclear deal, the broad strokes of which had just been announced, looks an awful lot like those ideal hypotheticals he'd put together in grad school. 
"When I was doing my nonproliferation training at Monterey, this is the type of inspection regime that we would dream up in our heads," he said at the time. "We would hope that this would be the way to actually verify all enrichment programs, but thought that would never be feasible."
Stein concluded it would make "an excellent deal" - if the negotiators could turn those broad strokes into a formal, finalized agreement. This week, they did exactly that.
The full, final Iran nuclear deal "exceeds in all areas,"  Stein said on Tuesday. "It makes the possibility of Iran developing a nuclear weapon in the next 25 years extremely remote."
Like many observers, I doubted in recent months that Iran and world powers would ever reach this stage; the setbacks and delays had simply been too many. Now here we are, and the terms are astoundingly favorable to the United States. Arms control and nuclear nonproliferation experts are heralding it as a huge success. 
The deal requires Iran to surrender some crucial components of its nuclear program, in part or even in whole. Here are the highlights:
Iran will give up about 14,000 of its 20,000 centrifuges. 
Iran will give up all but its most rudimentary, outdated centrifuges: Its first-generation IR-1s, knockoffs of 1970s European models, are all it gets to keep. It will not be allowed to build or develop newer models. 
Iran will give up 97 percent of its enriched uranium; it will hold on to only 300 kilograms of its 10,000-kilogram stockpile in its current form. 
Iran will destroy or export the core of its plutonium plant at Arak, and replace it with a new core that cannot produce weapons-grade plutonium. It will ship out all spent nuclear fuel. 
Iran would simply not have much of its nuclear program left after all this. 
A shorthand people sometimes use to evaluate the size of Iran's nuclear program is its "breakout time." If Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei woke up tomorrow morning and decided to set his entire nuclear program toward building a nuclear warhead - to "break out" to a bomb - as of today it would take him two or three months. Under the terms of the deal, his program would be so much smaller that it would take him an entire year to build a single nuclear warhead.
"I was shocked to read that they got them to agree to let us walk around their centrifuge production facilities. That's amazing." These terms are not abject surrender. Iran is allowed to keep a small nuclear program, and it won some concessions of its own. For example, what little uranium enrichment is allowed will be done at Iran's facility at Natanz - a hardened, reinforced-concrete structure that was once used for covert enrichment and that the US had hoped to close.
Iran will also be allowed to do some research at Fordow, another hardened facility the US had wanted to close, though the research is restricted and will be barred from using fissile material. These are not big concessions, and they matter mostly for their symbolic value, but it's something.
Still, when you look at many of the specifics laid out in the deal, the hard numbers and timetables and the detailed proscriptions, those all tend to be quite favorable to the United States.
The result is pretty clear, Stein said: "The intention of this agreement is to take the weapons option off the table for the next 25 years, and the agreement does that."
The deal is strong on many terms, but it strongest on what was  always going to be among the most crucial: inspections.
Whatever number of centrifuges Iran has or doesn't have, whatever amount of uranium it's allowed to keep or forced to give up, none of it matters unless inspectors have enough authority to hold Tehran to its end of the deal - and to convince the Iranians that they could never get away with cheating. To say the US got favorable terms here would be quite an understatement; the Iranians, when it comes to inspections, practically gave away the farm. 
"I would give it an A," Stein said, in April, of the framework. When I asked why: "Because of the inspections and transparency."
There are two reasons inspections are so important. The first is that super-stringent inspections are a deterrent: If the Iranians know that any deviation is going to be quickly caught, they have much less incentive to try to cheat, and much more incentive to uphold their side of the deal. 
"I would give it an A" The second is that if Iran were to try a build a nuclear weapon now, it likely wouldn't use the material that's already known to the world and being monitored. Rather, the Iranians would secretly manufacture some off-the-books centrifuges, secretly mine some off-the-books uranium, and squirrel it all away to a new, secret underground facility somewhere. That would be the only way for Iran to build up enough of an arsenal such that by the time the world found out, it would be too late to do anything about it.
Really robust inspections would be the best way stop that from happening. They would prevent Iran from sneaking off centrifuges or siphoning away uranium that could be used to build an off-the-grid nuclear weapons program, without the world finding out.
Under this deal, the inspections are so strong, Stein said, that if Iran tried to cheat on the deal, "the likelihood of getting caught is near 100 percent."
The inspections issue has not gotten much political attention. When I  spoke to Jeffrey Lewis, the director of the East Asia Nonproliferation Program at Middlebury's Monterey Institute of International Studies, back in March before the framework was announced, he seemed worried that negotiators would not focus on it much. Rather, overwhelming political focus in Washington and Tehran on issues like Iran's number of allowed centrifuges seemed likely to push inspections from the top priorities.
Lewis suggested that a top item on his wish list would be inspections so robust that inspectors don't just get to visit enrichment sites like Natanz and Fordow, but also centrifuge factories. That, he said, "would be a big achievement."
Sure enough, Lewis got his wish and then some: centrifuge factory inspections is one of the terms in the framework, and it's pretty robust. For the next 20 years, inspectors would have " continuous surveillance at Iran's centrifuge rotors and bellows production and storage facilities." 
That's part of why, when I asked Lewis to  grade the final deal this week, he gave me the same answer that Stein had: "I would give it an A."
"I was shocked to read that they got them to agree to let us walk around their centrifuge production facilities. That's amazing," Stein said in April, when the first terms came out. That provision is now part of the final deal. 
It's not just centrifuge factories. Inspectors will have access to all parts of Iran's nuclear supply chain, including its uranium mines and the mills where it processes uranium ore. Inspectors will also not just monitor but be required to pre-approve all sales to Iran of nuclear-related equipment. This provision also applies to something called "dual-use" materials, which means any equipment that  could be used toward a nuclear program.
" The inspections and transparency on the rotors, and the bellows, and the uranium mines is more than I ever thought would be in this agreement," Stein added. 
How the deal prevents Iran from going nuclear for the next 25 years
When I talked to Stein this week, we discussed the scenario that this deal is all about: What happens if Iran decides it wants to build a nuclear bomb? I asked him to walk me through how that would happen, and how effective this deal would be at stopping it.
"They would do Fordow 2.0," he said, referring to the underground Fordow facility where Iran had previously conducted secret and illegal nuclear development. In other words, they would build another underground bunker and do it there. Iran is a big country, and even very strong inspections can't spot every hole in the ground. But they would need two things for this, and both in large supply: uranium ore and centrifuges. This is where the deal comes in.
First, Stein explained, "They would siphon off uranium from an undeclared mine." But under the deal, "that's not really possible."
"Iran only has two mines," he said - both of which will be under heavy inspections and monitoring. "It does not have rich uranium deposits, despite its claims to the contrary. We should know - we helped develop those fields in the 1970s.
"If all of a sudden a barrel of uranium at a conversion facility doesn't show up, we'd know," he explained. "They [inspectors] have an accounting of what comes out of the ground; they have an accounting of what has been refined at the processing plant. They have an accounting of what's been converted, then they have an accounting of what shows up at Natanz, and then they have an accounting of what comes out the back end." 
But for the sake of seeing through the hypothetical, let's say that somehow, magically, Iran is able to sneak away the large amounts of uranium ore necessary for a bomb. Then what?
"Then they would build centrifuges without us knowing, because a centrifuge facility is tiny," Stein said. "You don't really pick them up; we've never really been able to find them when they are up."
The deal addresses this, as well: Not only will inspectors keep tabs on every single centrifuge in the country, but they will have eyes on the centrifuge factories, on machines that could be used to make a centrifuge, even on imports of technology that could be used to build a machine that could be used to build a centrifuge.
"The snapback thing is really clever" "In the agreement, they have to account for all of their flow forming machines [that can be used to build a centrifuge], give us a list of where they are, and then put them under monitoring," Stein said. "The counter to that is they just won't tell us, they won't declare everything. That's to be expected, so don't trust that." That's where the deal's monitoring of things like "dual use" technology, that can have non-nuclear as well as nuclear uses, comes into play.
Meanwhile, Iran will have a relatively small program of approved centrifuges and energy-grade uranium. But all of this will be under constant monitoring, making it essentially impossible for Iran to use them for anything nefarious without the world knowing pretty quickly.
But let's keep the hypothetical going. Let's say that Iran breaks the restrictions on centrifuges or uranium and that the inspectors or US intelligence, inevitably, find out. What happens then?
What happens is that international sanctions - the sanctions that so hurt Iran's economy that it came limping up to the negotiating table - come back. This was always going to be a very difficult part of the deal; the sanctions are so powerful because they come from the European Union and from the United Nations, backed even by China and Russia, all of whom are more skittish than the US about punishing Iran. So how do you make sure they'll go along with reimposing sanctions? How do you make that threat so severe and so certain that Iran won't dare test it?
The solution they came up with is an elaborate mechanism they're calling "snapback."
"The snapback thing is really clever, I had to read it a couple of times to make sure it said what I think it said," Jeffrey Lewis, the Middlebury nuclear expert, told me.
If the US thinks Iran is cheating, the first step is taking it to a special commission of the seven countries that signed the deal plus the European Union. "But wait," you're saying, "can't Russia or China just use this process to stall or outright block the US?" Nope, they can't, because if the US is still unhappy, after a few weeks it can kick the issue up to the UN Security Council.
"But wait," you say again, "won't Russia and China just veto anything the US brings up there?" Nope, they can't meddle there either. If the US complains to the Security Council, and after 30 days the Security Council does nothing - and the US can ensure it does nothing by vetoing any resolutions - then under the deal the sanctions will automatically come back into force.
"It sounds like the US can blow up the deal any time it wants and revert to sanctions," Lewis said. And there's a good reason for that: "That's just how things are anyway."
But say all of that happens - say that Iran cheats on the deal, we inevitable catch them, all the sanctions come back, and somehow Iran keeps chugging away anyway on illegal nuclear development. This seems unlikely - if this is Iran's plan, they just signed a deal making it far more difficult to do it - but it's worth imagining. What then?
"The military force issue would come back," Stein said. In other words, it would take us back where we were a few years ago, with the US threatening military action against Iran. It is worth again recalling that that ended with Iran agreeing to nuclear negotiations in which it willingly gave up the bulk of its nuclear program, so it seems to want to avoid this scenario.
But if this worst-case scenario should happen, then the deal is  still a net positive for the US. "I think the US hand is actually strengthened in this, to be honest with you," Stein said. "A full accounting of where everything is [gleaned from invasive inspections and monitoring] is a wonderful targeting mechanism for the Pentagon."
The terms in the agreement are just about the best that we could hope for - even better, in some ways, than many had thought possible. The concessions from Iran are painful and many; the concessions by the US minor and few; the details surprisingly robust.
"As a framework it's very good,"  Mark Fitzpatrick, the director of the Non-Proliferation and Disarmament Program at the International Institute for Strategic Studies, tweeted in April when the broad terms were revealed. He  added, "A sharp critic of Iran and skeptic of the talks told me after the announcement that it seemed to be heavily tilted in favour of the West."
The Arms Control Association issued a statement saying that the "historic" agreement "promises to lead to one of the most consequential and far-reaching nuclear nonproliferation achievements in recent decades."
Daryl Kimball, the Arms Control Association's chief,  told the Guardian, "The deal is a major nuclear nonproliferation breakthrough that promises to prevent the emergence of another nuclear-armed state and head off a nuclear arms race in the world's most volatile region."
Andrea Berger of the Royal United Services Institute  called it "an incredible achievement that much of the nuclear community will enthusiastically support." And on and on.
The way that all of this works is quite technical. But once you understand things like enrichment and inspections regimes and sanctions snapback, you see that the deal is actually pretty simple. Lewis put it well when we spoke:
I see it as a really straightforward measure to slow down an enrichment program that was going gangbusters.
So you ask, "Does it slow it down?" Yes. "Does it slow it down in a way that is verifiable?" Yes. "Does it slow it down more than bombing it would?" Yes. "Okay, good deal."
Watch: President Obama's remarks on nuclear deal with Iran
The basic dispute is this: Iran wants to keep at least some of its nuclear program, which it's had for years and insists is just for peaceful purposes. The outside world believes, with good reason, that Iran's program is at least partly designed to illegally develop a nuclear bomb, and wants the program to stop.
This has been bad for everybody. Iran's economy is crippled by sanctions. The world was facing a possible Iranian nuclear bomb, which would be very dangerous and worsen the already violent Middle East. It looked increasingly like this would end with the US having to choose between letting Iran develop a nuclear bomb or going to war.
This week's nuclear agreement is meant to resolve that years-long fight, to keep Iran from getting a nuclear bomb but let it keep a very small nuclear program, and to do it peacefully.
This process started almost immediately after Iranians elected a moderate president, Hassan Rouhani, in mid-2013. Iran came together in formal negotiations with a group of world powers known as the P5+1: Germany plus the five permanent members of the UN Security Council, which are the US, UK, Russia, China, and France. In April, they announced a "framework" deal of the broad strokes. It looked very favorable to the US and got  rave reviews from arms control experts. This week they released a final agreement that filled in the details.
The deal does this: Iran will give up the bulk of its nuclear program, namely its enriched uranium (nuclear fuel) and its centrifuges (which turn fuel into weapons material). That will leave it with a program way too small to build a bomb.
Iran will also submit to extremely invasive inspections. That's to make sure it isn't cheating, for example by sneaking nuclear material off to some secret facility and developing a bomb there. The idea is that Iran knows it can't get away with cheating, and will be punished if it does, so it won't try.
In exchange, the world will remove a lot of the economic sanctions it's placed on Iran, and Iran gets to keep just enough of a nuclear program that it can save face.
The provisions generally last at least 10 years, with some of them lasting 25 years, so this could be around for a long time.
If the deal works, it will prevent Iran from getting a nuclear bomb, it will ease Iran's economic suffering, and it will make war less likely - huge improvements. Arms control experts tend to say this is about the best we could get.
If the deal fails, then we will back where we are now, except that it will be much harder to reimpose those tough economic sanctions. That's a possibility, and deal critics have reason to worry. But this is almost certainly the world's best chance for averting both war and a nuclear Iran, and will likely be remembered as a huge legacy achievement for President Obama.
The final deal with Iran announced by the United States and other major world powers does what no amount of political posturing and vague threats of military action had managed to do before. It puts strong, verifiable limits on Iran's ability to develop a nuclear weapon for at least the next 10 to 15 years and is potentially one of the most consequential accords in recent diplomatic history, with the ability not just to keep Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon but also to reshape Middle East politics.
The deal, the product of 20 arduous months of negotiations, would obviously have provided more cause for celebration if Iran had agreed to completely dismantle all of its nuclear facilities. But the chances of that happening were effectively zero, and even if all of Iran's nuclear-related buildings and installations were destroyed, no one can erase the knowledge Iranian scientists have acquired after working on nuclear projects for decades.
As described by Mr. Obama and other officials, the deal seems sound and clearly in the interest of the United States, the other nations that drafted it and the state of Israel. In return for a phased lifting of international economic sanctions, Iran will reduce by 98 percent its stockpile of low-enriched uranium, which can be processed further into bomb-grade fuel, and reduce the number of operating centrifuges used to enrich that fuel by two-thirds, to 5,060. These limits mean that if Iran ever decides to violate the agreement and make a dash for a nuclear bomb, it will take a year to produce the weapons-grade fuel needed for a single bomb, compared with a couple of months now.
Many of the various restrictions in the agreement will be in force for 10 to 25 years. Some, notably Iran's agreement to constant and technologically advanced monitoring by the International Atomic Energy Agency, will last indefinitely, as will its commitment under the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty to never produce a nuclear weapon. Inspectors will have access to suspicious sites "where necessary, when necessary," President Obama said, and if Iran cheats, that will be detected early enough to respond, including by quickly reimposing sanctions or taking military action.
The deal nearly faltered on a demand by Iran and Russia that United Nations bans on the purchase and sale of conventional weapons and ballistic missiles be lifted immediately. But in the end, the accord requires that the conventional weapons ban remain in place for five years and the missile ban for eight years - assuming Iran abides by its commitments.
It is deeply unsettling that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel derisively dismissed the deal immediately as a "historic mistake." He, Republicans in Congress and most candidates for the Republican presidential nomination have opposed negotiations with Iran from the outset yet offered no credible alternative to a negotiated settlement. The Republican presidential hopefuls repeated that formula today - condemnation of the deal with no credible alternative to offer.
That said, no one should have any illusions about Iran, which considers Israel a sworn enemy; often condemns the United States; supports Hezbollah and other terrorist organizations; and aspires to greater influence in the region. Once sanctions are lifted, it stands to gain access to billions of dollars from accounts in international banks that have been frozen and from new oil exports and other business deals.
American officials say that Iran will get that money over time, and that its immediate priority will be to deal with pressing domestic needs. More important, many American sanctions will remain in place even after the deal is implemented, including those relating to Iran's support for terrorism and its human rights violations. The United States has to be extremely vigilant in monitoring how Iran uses those new funds and in enforcing those sanctions.
Agreeing on the nuclear deal is just the first step. Congress gets to review and vote on it. Powerful forces, like Mr. Netanyahu, have vowed to defeat it, and Mr. Obama may have to make good on his vow to veto any resolution of disapproval. It would be irresponsible to squander this chance to rein in Iran's nuclear program.
WASHINGTON - As President Obama begins his three-week push to win approval of the Iran nuclear deal, he is confronting this political reality: His strongest argument in favor of passage has also become his greatest vulnerability.
Mr. Obama has been pressing the case that the sharp limits on how much nuclear fuel Iran can hold, how many centrifuges it can spin and what kind of technology it can acquire would make it extraordinarily difficult for Iran to race for the bomb over the next 15 years.
His problem is that most of the significant constraints on Tehran's program lapse after 15 years - and, after that, Iran is free to produce uranium on an industrial scale.
"The chief reservation I have about the agreement is the fact that in 15 years they have a highly modern and internationally legitimized enrichment capability," said Representative Adam B. Schiff, a California Democrat who supports the accord. "And that is a bitter pill to swallow."
Even some of the most enthusiastic backers of the agreement, reached by six world powers with Iran, say they fear Mr. Obama has oversold some of the accord's virtues as he asserts that it would "block" all pathways to a nuclear weapon.
A more accurate description is that the agreement is likely to delay Iran's program for a decade and a half - just as sanctions and sabotage have slowed Iran in recent years. The administration's case essentially is that the benefits over the next 15 years overwhelmingly justify the longer-term risks of what comes after.
"Of course there are risks, and they have to be acknowledged," said R. Nicholas Burns, who was undersecretary of state in the George W. Bush administration and has testified before Congress in favor of the deal. Mr. Obama's "most convincing argument," he added, "is that there is no better alternative out there."
In making the administration's case, Mr. Obama can underscore that economic sanctions on Iran begin to lift only as it reduces its current stockpile of low enriched uranium, to 300 kilograms, or 660 pounds. That is not enough to make a single nuclear weapon, and is a 98 percent reduction in its current stockpile of nearly 12 tons.
The accord also calls for regular inspections at Iran's nuclear installations and includes arrangements to reimpose international sanctions if the Iranians are caught cheating.
But the flip side is that after 15 years, Iran would be allowed to produce reactor-grade fuel on an industrial scale using far more advanced centrifuges. That may mean that the warning time if Iran decided to race for a bomb would shrink to weeks, according to a recent Brookings Institution analysis by Robert J. Einhorn, a former member of the American negotiating team.
Critics say that by that time, Iran's economy would be stronger, as would its ability to withstand economic sanctions, and its nuclear installations probably would be better protected by air defense systems, which Iran is expected to buy from Russia.
Some members of Congress and other experts are urging the administration to take fresh steps to deter Iran from edging dangerously close to a nuclear weapons capability after the main limits in the agreement expire.
"I believe it buys 15 years for real," said Dennis B. Ross, who served as a White House adviser on Iran during Mr. Obama's first term and has yet to decide if he will back the accord. "But I do see vulnerabilities that I feel must be addressed. The gap between threshold and weapons status after year 15 is small."
A Loss of Leverage The duration of the agreement is the most important and complex issue. Under restrictions imposed by the accord, Iran would need a full year to produce enough nuclear material for a bomb; currently that timeline is two or three months, according to American intelligence agencies. But starting at year 10, that "breakout time" would begin to shrink again, as Iran gets more centrifuges into operation.
Administration officials argue that it would be obvious if Iran made weapons-grade fuel, and negotiators secured a permanent ban on the metallurgy needed to turn the fuel into a bomb.
Supporters of the agreement are betting that improved intelligence would deter Iran from racing for a bomb. Under the agreement, inspectors will be able to monitor the production of rotors and other centrifuge components for up to 20 years and can monitor Iran's stocks of uranium ore concentrate for 25 years.
Skeptics counter that, after 15 years, the United States would lose much of its leverage to stop a program. So Mr. Obama is trying to assure Congress that he and his successors will create that leverage.
In a letter last week to Representative Jerrold Nadler, a Democrat from New York, Mr. Obama detailed the expanded military support he has offered Israel and reaffirmed that the United States retains the option to use economic sanctions and even military force should Iran break out of its agreement.
But Mr. Obama's letter was mostly a repackaging of previous assurances made to lawmakers, to Israel and to diplomats from Arab nations by the Persian Gulf.
Some backers of the agreement are urging the White House and Congress to do more. Mr. Schiff and Mr. Ross suggested in interviews that the United States should put Iran on notice that its production of highly enriched uranium after the main provisions of the accord expire would be taken by American officials as an indication that Iran has decided to pursue nuclear weapons - and could trigger an American military strike.
And both said the United States should also be prepared to provide bunker-busting bombs to Israel to deter Iran from trying to shield illicit nuclear work underground. Others have called for a long-term congressional "authorization to use military force" if Iran violated the accord.
Mr. Ross has also urged the White House to specify the penalties for smaller violations of the accord, an idea Mr. Obama rejected in his letter, saying he wanted to maintain "flexibility" to decide what responses might be needed.
Energy Secretary Ernest J. Moniz told a House committee last month that any attempt by Iran to produce highly enriched uranium "at any time must earn a sharp response by all necessary means."
But some experts like Mr. Einhorn say that this warning should be conveyed directly, if privately, to Iran and that the United States should also increase intelligence sharing with the world's nuclear inspector, the International Atomic Energy Agency, about possible Iranian cheating.
"The way to address challenges not covered by the agreement is to supplement it, not renegotiate it," Mr. Einhorn said.
Accounting for the Past One of the trickier issues for Mr. Obama, and for Congress, is how to assess whether Iran has truly come clean about its past nuclear activities, an enormously sensitive issue for the Iranians. And in the end, it is one that Secretary of State John Kerry decided not to press too hard during negotiations, for fear it would undermine the chances of getting stronger inspections for current and future activity.
The job of assessing past activities is up to the I.A.E.A. It must certify on Oct. 15 that Iran is complying with a "road map" for cooperation and report in December on the agency's conclusions - especially about Iran's alleged work developing nuclear triggers and designing warheads.
Critics of the accord note that Mr. Kerry and his chief negotiator, Wendy R. Sherman, said repeatedly that Iran must provide access to "people, places and documents" that would resolve those questions, something Iran has refused to do for years. But the I.A.E.A. has never publicly specified what it is asking, or whom it must meet.
Mr. Einhorn, in his analysis, concluded that "a full and honest disclosure by Iran of its past weaponization activities - which would contradict Tehran's narrative of an exclusively peaceful program as well the supreme leader's fatwa that Islam forbids nuclear weapons - was never in the cards."
That said, he concludes, that may not be a "serious obstacle" to concluding Iran's work has halted.
Accessing Nuclear Sites While the accord calls for regular inspections at Iran's nuclear sites, the enforcement is of limited duration. For example, while the I.A.E.A. can request access to all declared nuclear sites under the agreements it has with all member states, the far more intrusive monitoring at Iran's main nuclear enrichment site at Natanz is not mandated after 15 years. At that point, Iran also would be free to carry out nuclear enrichment at other locations.
But the issue that has garnered the most attention is a "24-day" rule for resolving disputes if Iran refuses to give inspectors access to a suspicious site - another measure that expires after 15 years. (After that, inspectors can still demand to enter sites, but under the existing rules, which do not set a deadline for compliance.) Critics say that is far different from "anywhere, anytime" access - a phrase Mr. Moniz and others in the administration used a few months ago, and have come to regret.
If Iran balks at an inspection, then a commission - which includes Iran - can decide on punitive steps, including a reimposition of economic sanctions. A majority vote of the commission suffices, so even if Iran, China and Russia objected, the sanctions could go into effect.
That is the theory. In practice, reimposing sanctions could be politically challenging. Iran has warned that if sanctions are reimposed it will no longer be bound by the accord. The I.A.E.A., perhaps fearing its inspectors would be kicked out, might hesitate to start the 24-day clock.
Mr. Moniz argues that the 24-day time frame is sufficient because Iran will not be able to cover up evidence of nuclear work during that period, since traces of nuclear materials could be expected well after three weeks. But some experts say that Iran could cover up smaller-scale illicit activities, including work on the specialized high-explosives that might serve as a trigger in a nuclear bomb.
