V The same is true for the Iran deal announc Tuesday between Iran and six world power As Congress begin debat the agreement it oppon have three real altern The first is to kill the deal and the interim agreement that preced it and do noth els which mean few restraint on Iran s nuclear program The second is war But top American and Isra offici have warn that militari action against Iranian nuclear facil could ignit a catastroph region conflict and would be ineffect if not counterproduct in delay Iran s path to the bomb Meir Dagan who oversaw the Iran file as head of Israel s extern spi agenc the Mossad from 2002 to 2011 ha said an attack mean region war and in that case you would have given Iran the best possibl reason to continu the nuclear program Michael Hayden who ran the CIA under Georg W Bush from 2006 to 2009 ha warn that an attack would that which we are tri to prevent: an Iran that will spare noth to build a nuclear weapon

V Look It s My Name on Thi Obama Defend the Iran Nuclear DealImplicitly acknowledg thi most critic of the Iran deal propos a third alternative: increas sanction in hope of forc Iran to make further concess But in the short term the third altern look a lot like the first Whatev it defici the Iran deal place limit on Iran s nuclear program and enhanc oversight of it Walk away from the agreement in hope of get tougher restrict and you re guarante at least for the time be that there are bare ani restrict on the program at all

V What s more even if Congress pass new sanction it s quit like that the overal econom pressur on Iran will go down not up Most major European and Asian countri have closer econom tie to Iran than doe the Unit State and thu more domest pressur to resum them These countri have abided by intern sanction against Iran to vari degre becaus the Obama administr convinc their leader that sanction were a necessari prelud to a diplomat deal If U S offici reject a deal Iran s histor trade partner will not econom injur themselv indefinit Sanction declar Britain s ambassador to the Unit State in May have alreadi reach high water mark note that would probabl see more sanction erosion" if nuclear talk fail Germani s ambassador ad that diplomaci fail then the sanction regim might unravel

V The nuclear agreement nearli 100 page is long on technic detail that will be pars by highli experienc non prolifer expert But it ha sever compon that diminish and limit Iran s nuclear capabl Accord to the agreement Iran ha decid to drastic cut back on it number of centrifug The Fordow facil built under a mountain and impervi to most militari option will be turn into a research and scienc facil a smart compromis between Iran and the P5+1 The Arak heavi water reactor will be modifi so it cannot be use for product of nuclear weapon And Iran agre to keep it stockpil of enrich uranium to a minimum The Iranian nuclear program will also come under the close scrutini of the Intern Atom Energi Agenc IAEA Critic have claim that Iran should be subject to anywhere" inspect but it is complet unrealist to expect ani sovereign countri undef in war to accept such measur Iran may object to IAEA request for inspect but a major of the P5+1 can overrul it object Thi is a formula that give a clear advantag to the Unit State

V The nuclear deal will not transform Iran Suprem Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and the Revolutionari Guard will maintain control and attempt to prevent ani meaning chang Rouhani while pragmat enough to sign a nuclear deal is also cautiou enough not to make ani sudden move that could jolt the polit system and undermin hi own polit author But million of Iranian that seek chang will be given more space to breath The 2009 mass Green Movement demonstr a thirst for chang in Iran Iranian have been wait for a deal for year but they more than anyon are realist enough to realiz it limit
p12
sI12
V The deal is not perfect The strongest limit on Iran s nuclear program will last 10 to 15 year Iran will be more free to expand it nuclear program after that period but it will still remain under intern inspect And a deal will not chang the Iranian regim or it support for anti American forc in the Middl East Howev the nuclear deal is a first step for chang in Iran Chang may be slow to come as Iranian have long expect After all the 1979 revolut seemingli sudden and full of promis transform Iran forev and for the wors as mani Iranian are concern So slow chang may be the best option for them Washington for now ha come to the same conclus Posit chang in Iran cannot be achiev through war sanction and unend pressur It will take increment step The nuclear deal while not perfect is a step in the right direct

V How to make sens of the nuclear deal with Iran? Is it a necessari compromis that s prefer to the altern and potenti benefici for the Middl East? A feebl and indefens sop to Iranian leader bent on further destabil the region? A practic satisfi but moral troubl gambl born of bad options? The Atlant s Peter Beinart David Frum and Jeffrey Goldberg debat the new agreement and the swift and fierc reaction to it

V Oppon keep say that thi deal isn t as good as the Obama administr promis it would be and that it violat previou U S red line That s true It allow Iran to keep some enrich uranium It also doesn t includ anytim anywher right away inspect which I think the Obama administr wa foolish to promis a kind of parallel to when they said no one would lose coverag as a result of Obamacare
p18
sI18
V Wa the Iran Deal Worth It?Proponents like myself compar it to the alternatives: which are do noth war or tri to increas sanction in hope of get a better deal down the line What frustrat me is how rare I see oppon explain in ani detail how ani of these altern would be prefer A few year ago one saw more hawk argu for a militari strike I detail some of the folk who did last year But one rare hear anyon these day argu that a militari strike make sens Some say that a threat of force" would make Iran conced more But Israel and America have been threaten forc for a decad now Whi would more saber rattl work now? Besid to have your threat of forc be credibl don t you have to be will to follow through which requir explain whi militari action would be effect in retard the nuclear program and wouldn t make the current region conflict far worse? More often deal oppon talk about increas sanction which would supposedli forc Iran into concess But I rare hear them explain how that will work given the intern polit of Iran Seem more like to me that scuttl thi deal and pass more sanction would devast Iranian Presid Rouhani and Iranian Foreign Minist Zarif polit Rouhani wa elect to improv the economi torpedo the deal would make him a failur That would empow those hardline oppon who never want ani deal Beyond that what basi is there to believ European and Asian countri which have strong econom interest in Iran will maintain sanction indefinitely? The lesson of Iraq in the 1990s is that sanction erod over time British and German diplomat have warn that if the U S destroy the deal sanction could unravel So whi should we believ econom pressur will go up and lead to more Iranian concessions? Seem at least as like to me that econom pressur will go down
p19
sI19
V I also don t feel that oppon of the deal who wax moralist about Obama s failur to be vocal enough in support the Green Revolut have grappl much publicli with what appear to be the overwhelm support of Iranian dissid for thi deal If we believ that ultim the most import thing is the potenti for polit chang in Iran and the peopl who would make that chang want thi deal doesn t that carri real weight? I m not say thi deal will bring polit chang anytim soon Obvious nobodi know if it will Call me cynic but seem to me that hawk like use the Iranian dissid when it help them argu for a cold war postur But the minut it doesn t they pretend those dissid don t exist

V The Unit State did not negoti the way peopl negoti to get the best deal obtain It signal from the start of the talk that it regard the militari option supposedli alway the table" as in fact unthink It collar Congress to prevent imposit of new sanction when the Iranian act balki It wa a mistak too to send the secretari of state to head the deleg especi a secretari of state who had been a presidenti nominee: Secretari Kerri wa too big to be allow to fail Hi Iranian counterpart by contrast could easili be disavow by a regim whose suprem author alway maintain a wide distanc from the talk

p33

V Claim negoti agreement undercut America s abil to use forc America s histori of negoti and agreement over weapon of mass destruct with enemi power sinc the end of World War II make clear that deal to constrain nuclear weapon are not an altern to militari econom polit and covert instrument in geopolit competit Instead they are one strand of a coher comprehens strategi for protect and advanc American nation interest

p35

V Whi the Iran Deal Make Obama s Critic So AngryThis is not my conclus onli It is the judgment of the individu who arguabl know the most about use militari forc to prevent state from acquir nuclear weapon As a young soldier in the Isra Air Forc Amo Yadlin wa one of the pilot who drop the bomb that destroy Iraq s Osirak reactor in 1981 As Israel s head of militari intellig he design the attack that destroy Syria s nuclear plant and develop capabl and plan for attack Iran s nuclear program Assess the paramet of the framework agreement that Iran and world power struck in April Yadlin wrote M ilitary action against the Iranian nuclear program in 2025 would in all probabl not be much more complic or difficult than in 2015 T he Iranian program will be reduc compar to what it is today intellig about it will be better and it will be less immun than it is at present
p36
sI36
V Much ink ha alreadi been spill over the implic of a nuclear deal with Iran for that countri s assert region behavior Arab state and Israel warn of Iranian hegemoni and demand assert American engag to back But the one place where they are most interest in see step up American engag is the one place where Presid Obama is least like to indulg them Syria And fear of Iran and American withdraw Arab state are increasingli dug in against do the two thing that more than ani other could help gird the Middl East against greater Iranian influenc resolv the Arab world s bitter civil war and strengthen the resili of Arab societi As a result I don t expect that thi nuclear agreement will make much differ one way or the other in the chaotic and increasingli violent region pictur
p37
sI37
V In hi remark thi morn Presid Obama himself hasten to say that hi support of the deal t mean that thi deal will resolv all of our differ with Iran We share the concern express by mani of our friend in the Middl East includ Israel and the Gulf State about Iran s support for terror and it use of proxi to destabil the region

V Iran s region troublemaking is like to worsen regardless of a deal
p39
sI39
V Iran s procliv for region meddl is longstand and the chaotic polit of the Arab world sinc 2011 ha given the Islam Republ unpreced opportun to insert itself into local polit in destabil way In my recent congression testimoni and in remark to the Herzliya Confer in Israel last month I explain my view that Iran s region troublemaking is like to grow wors in come year regardless of a deal over the nuclear program I said:
p40
sI40
V In fact whether there s a nuclear deal or not I predict we will see a more aggress approach by Iran in a host of arena around the region where the upheav ha given them greater opportun than befor
p41
sI41
V If there is a nuclear deal the hardline element within the Iranian regim those most oppos to a deal are also those with the greatest interest and invest in region troublemaking They are like to use their abil to make nois region to tri and compens for the power disadvantag they see inher in a deal and they are like to have a green light from the Suprem Leader to do so becaus he will want to compens them for their unhappi with a deal
p42
sI42
V If there s no deal on the nuclear issu howev then the Iranian leadership will want to scale up it region assert of power for a differ reason: in order to solidifi or even strengthen it current region power posit in advanc of whatev tougher American Isra Sunni Arab effort it anticip to contain it
p43
sI43
V I stand by that predict While sanction relief will give Iran consider more resourc it ha never lack motiv for it assert of power and it continu to face ampl opportun As my Herzliya panel partner Meir Javandefar reveal at the confer Iran s sanction induc econom hardship in recent year ha not prevent Iran from spend billion of dollar and it own soldier live keep Bashar al Assad in power So ye Iranian meddl across the region will get wors in the wake of an Iran deal but it wa go to get wors anyway
p44
sI44
V The real question about Iran s region behavior is not therefor whether a nuclear deal is too danger for the Middl East becaus it will give Iran more abil to make troubl Troubl in case you haven t notic is not lack in the Middl East and Iran is one major sourc though not to be sure the onli one The real question is what the Unit State and America s Arab alli are prepar to do about it Note that in my view America s Arab alli have an essenti role to play here independ of the Unit State Read on to see what I mean The region competit with Iran remain the highest prioriti for Arab state
p45
sI45
V My trip to Israel and the Gulf last month made clear that the broader region power struggl with Iran remain the singl most import consider for Arab govern not ISI and other extremist terror not the civil war eras state border and not domest instabl But I wa struck by how unidimensional my Arab interlocutor think is today about an Iranian Arab power struggl that s gone on as long as most of them have been aliv As they see it now Iran is the sourc of all instabl in today s Middl East: of sectarian civil conflict domest dissent And Iran s success rise or fall on the scope of American assert of power in the Middl East thu the US withdraw of forc from Iraq wa a signal error that cede that one Emirati said wa like the secur of the Gulf over to Iran
p46
sI46
V It is amaz to realiz the extent to which two decad of American militari engag in the Middl East have so thoroughli reshap Arab expect such that they now cannot imagin live safe across the Gulf from Iran unless the region is bristl with American troop And yet thi is their consid view And in the absenc of the American intervent they seek they are act on their own As I told Congress thi spring:
p47
sI47
V Our Sunni alli are alreadi up their effort in counter Iran region as the Yemen oper and the renew invest in the Syrian rebel demonstr Iran will have both the mean and the incent to respond in kind Thi is a recip for an escalatory spiral perhap most particularli in Syria and Iraq
p48
sI48
V What thi mean is that no matter how much the US govern assert it primari region interest in combat ISI and Al Qaeda our major region partner will remain resolut focus on the Iranian threat as their primari concern And it mean that in reassur and bolster it partner as part of ani Iranian nuclear deal the Unit State cannot limit itself to the nuclear issu or to tradit defens and deterr
p49
sI49
V No matter what equip or system the Unit State is will to sell to it Arab partner no matter what aid it is will to provid no matter what US asset the administr is prepar to base in the region our partner are look for a differ kind of reassur They are look to see the Unit State demonstr it recognit of Iran s troublesom activ around the region and demonstr it readi to push back against Iran s expansion around the region And the primari arena in which the Arab state wish to see that from the Unit State is in Syria
p50
sI50
V Of cours American retic in Syria is quit clear consist and support by a wide array of the American polit spectrum The Syrian arena is the one where the current US presid is least like to undertak ani more assert action to counter Iran though he is increasingli will to invest American power in counter ISI there So if they are count on American intervent in Syria to push back Iran the Arab partner are like to be disappoint
p51
sI51
V A nuclear deal doe not leav America s region alli helpless against Iran
p52
sI52
V And yet America s region alli should not therefor conclud that the Iranian nuclear deal leav them helpless against a loom onslaught of well fund subvers and insurg Even if the benefit to Iran from sanction relief amount to the estim billion sanction relief will take month even to begin and will take far longer to fulli play out That billion will not flow to Iranian coffer overnight and that mean that the Unit State and it Arab partner have a window of opportun to work togeth now to bolster their effort to contain Iranian effort and strengthen Arab societi against Iranian meddl
p53
sI53
V The measur the White Hous roll out after the US GCC Camp David summit are an import but insuffici dimens of thi approach ballist missil defens measur joint exercis border secur support and cooper on cybersecurity will all help to demonstr resolv and thu to deter ani escal by Iran of it effort at troublemaking in the Gulf But more can be done and not by Washington alon

V My hous wa rob some year ago one winter night when I went out and left the back door unlock The robber are guilti to be sure for their bad intent and for steal my stuff Mayb they would have broken a window to get in even if I had lock the door But although they are thoroughli bad appl I can t avoid my own respons for make it so easi for them carri out their nefari plan Now I have an alarm system and new lock that I use dilig
p55
sI55
V Similarli it s difficult but necessari for Arab leader to acknowledg that their and their colleagu fail help gener the expand opportun Iran ha found for troublemaking sinc 2011 and their action now can shape Iran s scope for troublemaking in the futur The fail govern corrupt repress and abus that produc the Arab upris and the brutal respons of some Arab leader to those upris spark civil conflict in Syria Libya and Yemen and ongo crisi in Bahrain fractur societi and open wide new window for Iranian influenc The sectarian rhetor Arab leader use to ralli their publics against Bashar al Assad at the outset of the Syrian civil war likewis stoke resent and rift against the Shia within their own societi

V Arab govern can turn the tide of region chao
p57
sI57
V Iran and more recent as bomb in Qatif and Kuwait show ISI are the beneficiari of these domest divis No doubt Iran wa look for such opportun and wa eager to exploit them But instead of continu to leav their door unlock the Arab govern still stand in thi chaotic region can do two thing right now to tri and turn the tide and in the process enhanc the prospect for more activ American engag in the region down the line
p58
sI58
V First they need to move urgent to push the Arab world s civil war toward resolut The fractiou parti in Yemen Syria and Libya are not easi to work with but Arab leader can ensur that their engag support diplomaci and negoti peac rather than exacerb divis among faction and prolong the fight Reportedli thi wa one agre upon agenda item at Camp David but the follow up ha been slow
p59
sI59
V Second Arab govern should urgent do what they can to strengthen the resili of their own societi and their resist to Iranian effort at penetr subvers and manipul The best way to do that is to act now to tamp down the rampant sectarian of the past few year and to replac it with posit effort at a more pluralist and inclus model of citizenship and govern
p60
sI60
V While individu cleric and Sunni movement may have their concern and prefer regard form of Islam the state must be resolut neutral in embrac all it citizen equal and must not just abjur but oppos effort by those movement to defin ani of their fellow citizen as illegitim foreign
p61
sI61
V Measur to ensur toler and protect for religi and ethnic minor within the Arab world will not onli harden these societi against Iranian subvers they will also margin extremist voic on the Sunni side who recruit for ISI and it ilk and they will strengthen the determin of these societi to resist the action reaction cycl of violenc that extremist of all kind tri to produc to further their own end
p62
sI62
V Presid Obama anger Arab govern by note befor the GCC summit at Camp David that their greatest secur threat may not come from extern aggress but from within their own societi Observ the natur of Iranian behavior in the Middl East those two threat may be two side of the same coin And if Arab leader fear the consequ of sanction relief for Iranian action they could seiz the chanc now to strengthen their own foundat and gird their societi against what is like to come
p63
sI63
V I ve resist the urg to comment much on the Iran negoti in part becaus I want to support a deal and now that it s been struck I do but with major reserv I can t help feel that we ve paid a tremend cost for what can onli be describ as a narrow if understand focu on the minutia of Iran s nuclear program includ extrem technic question about for exampl centrifug I ve found it hard to relat to thi sort of discuss becaus I ve never quit seen Iran s nuclear capabl as the issu Iran s nuclear program matter of cours but it matter more becaus of the kind of region actor Iran happen to be if Iran wa a U S alli and a democraci we d be have a differ convers Our Gulf alli for all their fault recogn thi For them thi Iran s destabil role in the region wa what worri them most And while they exagger Iran s meddl while conveni elid their own they were right to view Iran as a fundament neg forc in place like Syria and Lebanon
p64
sI64
V The Obama administr underscor time and time again that thi wasn t about Iran s other activ in the region: it wa about the nuclear program Thi I gather wa intend to reassur but it effect wa the opposit Sure ani Iran deal depend on the nuclear issu from everyth els but the problem wa that everyth els matter a whole lot and perhap just as much To the extent that a success deal and keep the European on board depend on the drawback of a deal were built in to the process These start assumpt did not start with Presid Obama but with Bush a fact all too often ignor
p65
sI65
V Administr can of cours and chew gum at the same time but that neglect the interrel natur of Middl East conflict The boutiqu case by base approach to the region that Obama ha champion sound smart and nuanc in theori a welcom respit Bush s self conscious grandios framework but if the Arab Spring underscor anyth it s that polit are rare onli local In nearli everi major crisi and conflict whether in Syria Iraq Yemen Libya Egypt Lebanon or Bahrain extern actor with region ambit have play an outsized even decis role
p66
sI66
V It s difficult to believ in the durabl of Egyptian authoritarian without understand Saudi Arabia and the Unit Arab Emir view of the Muslim Brotherhood as a transnat and not just a local threat In Iraq Iran seem like a potenti or actual partner in the war on ISI until you realiz that Iran is the determin patron of the Syrian regim whose brutal ha fuel ISI rise to promin Meanwhil the Obama administr s first" strategi against ISI seem reason until you realiz our oppon treat Iraq and Syria as a combin theater and that the fact that we don t put us at a profound disadvantag In short think that we can the Iranian nuclear issu or even Iran suggest a detach from the region s realiti as they re actual live
p67
sI67
V It is fairli easi at least for most peopl to actual walk and chew gum at the same time Do one doesn t affect the other which make it an inapt metaphor for policymaking The Obama administr s decis to focu on Iran s nuclear program and to a lesser extent the Isra Palestinian conflict meant that we could and would do less of other thing and do them less well Polit capit and bandwidth are finit resourc Policymaking is about to decid what to priorit particularli when the presid and a small coteri of close advisors are pull in seemingli endless number of compet direct
p68
sI68
V When it come to alli especi one that becom nervou rather quickli and act rashli when nervou you can afford to alien them but onli up to a point So you pick your battl We want the Saudi to limit their public critic of the Iran talk and to go along with them howev grudgingli We knew thi wa ask a lot which made it difficult to make other big ask on say put pressur on the Sissi regim in Egypt to be even just a tini bit less repress But it is perhap in Yemen where the most damag ha been done And thi isn t just about the civil war From 2011 onward we outsourc our Yemen polici to Saudi Arabia To correct thi we outsourc our Yemen polici to Saudi Arabia
p69
sI69
V It s no secret that our Gulf alli feel that we haven t done nearli enough to counter Iran s ambit in the region The fact that Obama seem to hold out hope that a deal could help rehabilit Iran both region and intern doesn t help matter But put that asid we do know that Saudi Arabia and other Gulf countri opt to launch a destruct intervent in Yemen at tremend human cost in part becaus of fear of U S disengag and nervous over U S polici toward Iran As Ken Pollack recent testifi to Congress: privat GCC offici make no bone in say that they felt compel to interven in Yemen becaus the Unit State wa embrac Iran rather than deter or defeat it American offici despit have major qualm about the intervent had littl interest in pick a fight with Saudi Arabia over Yemen when they were alreadi expend their polit capit to reassur the Saudi about the Iran negoti
p70
sI70
V Then there s Syria It wa clear from the start of the upris that Obama did in fact have a clear object minim U S involv as much as possibl But there are other place such as Iraq where the Obama administr wa pull back in despit or more like becaus of it best effort The unwilling to rethink Syria strategi in ani seriou way ha been reinforc by the momentum of Iran negoti Whi rock the boat and potenti provok a major intern incid when progress wa be made on Iran s nuclear program? Whi even take the chanc with so much at stake? moreov wa been built in to the polici process As the journalist Josh Rogin noted: Syria propos at State must go through the offic of the undersecretari for polit affair Wendi Sherman who is also the administr s lead negoti over a nuclear deal with Iran
p71
sI71
V On the specif of a deal I tend to think like mani that the U S made too mani concess without get enough in return Accord to the New York Time in the final day of talk a televis anchor on a hardline Iranian channel said: fact is Obama need thi deal much more than we do She went on: American presid need a victori and onli a deal with Iran can give him that They have retreat on sever issu and compromis on their own red line Whether or not thi percept is fair it s a percept nonetheless and percept drive behavior
p72
sI72
V Other have note that Iran due to it deterior economi need a deal more than the U S did Thi is almost certainli true But while Iran may have need it more the U S want it more or at the veri least seem like it did Some of thi to be fair wa outsid the U S s control The percept had alreadi solidifi throughout the region draw on 6 year of observ the Obama administr s handl of variou crise most notabl the back down from state lines" in Syria Alli such as Egypt and enemi such as Syria have grown confid that we ll blink first in a stare contest in part becaus we usual do Thi wa whi I wa skeptic that ani final deal could ever be the best possibl deal The administr ha had tendenc to misus and/or underestim it leverag in some of our most import bilater relationship As the negoti wrap to a close there wa no obviou way to address thi It wa too late We couldn t chang how Iran view the Obama administr
p73
sI73
V There wa a relat asymmetri dure the negoti As Pollack note don t think that Iran valu a nuclear deal as much as it doe it posit in these variou countri With us it wa the reverse: we care less about Iran s posit in variou countri and more about it nuclear program Thi too wa built in to the talk
p74
sI74
V Some are troubl that most peopl had strong opinion about the deal befor read the actual text of the agreement One certainli hope that legisl will eventu read at least some of it But the specif of the deal aren t ultim as import as the broader issu and implic and those aren t anywher to be found in the text Here I tend to agre with my colleagu Jeremi Shapiro who argu in April that that the devil wasn t in the detail The detail don t matter He goe on: heart thi is a fight over what to do about Iran s challeng to U S leadership in the Middl East and the threat that Iranian geopolit ambit pose to U S alli

V In other word your posit on the Iran deal is like to depend on how you view the Middl East and America s role in it more broadli If you see the Syrian civil war as a or even the core region conflict then you re probabl worri about the billion in potenti sanction relief Iran even we assum it choos butter over gun as American offici hope and use say onli 3 percent of that total will have billion more to prop up the Syrian regim and other region alli and proxi It also depend on your start assumpt about the natur of the Iranian regim Are Iranian leader and do you think it matter whether such as Presid Rouhani and Foreign Minist Zarif are empow over their counterparts?

V For me at least one other issu come into play and it s a factor which ha push me to be more support of the Iran deal than I expect to be It s strike how littl discuss there ha been about what Iranian think and want As small d democrat American should alway at least take into account public opinion in other countri Presum Iranian know their countri better than American politician do Accord to opinion poll a major of Iranian favor a deal We all saw the pictur of ordinari Iranian celebr the framework agreement in April Thi time around the regim ha been more care close off public space with hardlin warn of the danger of Iran Deal induc Importantli as Nader Hashemi note of the most vocifer defend of a nuclear deal with the West are Iranian civil societi and human right activist It make littl sens for us to say that an Iran deal will make progress on human right less like when Iran s own human right activist seem to think the opposit In a survey of 22 lead human right activist support for ongo negoti wa while over half believ that a deal would lead to a signific improv on human right in Iran Of cours they could be wrong but we shouldn t bet on that

V To be sure the link between a deal and the empower of Iranian reform as intuit as it might seem is far from guarante As mani have note conserv may be just as like to gain from a deal for ani number of reason What seem inescap howev is that the failur of negoti would have been a major perhap even decis loss for Iran s reformist trend Presid Hassan Rouhani who buoy expect with hi come from behind elect victori two year ago ha been lose popular and goodwil On human right he pledg to expand person freedom and broaden space for civil societi As for the economi it can sputter along as it ha but without sanction relief Rouhani s hand are tie Hi raison d etre then depend on a success deal Without one we would have like had more of the same: conserv in control and domin the countri s polit Now at the least there is a glimmer of possibl even if the road toward substant reform remain a difficult one

V Look It s My Name on Thi Obama Defend the Iran Nuclear DealAnd yet the deal though repres a moral dubiou compromis with a terror support theocraci might be from the perspect of U S nation secur a practic necess I m write thi just as the deal is be announc and I think it is danger to make sweep judgment about a complic document I ve onli skim And of cours there will be plenti of time in Washington over the next 60 day for sweep judgment But here is the most import question to ask go forward: Doe thi deal significantli reduc the chanc that Iran could in the forese futur 20 year is the time period Obama mention in an interview with me in May continu it nefari activ under the protect of a nuclear umbrella? If the answer to thi question is ye then a deal in theori is worth support

How quickli will inspector be abl to visit site they want to visit? I m also worri about the time base rather than condit base lift of arm embargo the Unit State should never acquiesc to a flow of arm to a terror sponsor state and about Iran s abil to continu it research and develop on ballist missil and other aspect of a nuclear program I also believ that so call sanction are a fiction: The U S could reimpos sanction on Iran if Tehran cheat on the deal but it would be reimpos these sanction on what will be a much richer countri one that could withstand such sanction for quit a while

V What is your impress of the agreement sign today by the Unit State UK Franc Russia China and Germani and Iran? Like ani other negoti agreement there are thing in it that are attract and thing in it that give one paus On the attract side are obvious the limit on the qualiti and quantiti of centrifug and the signific limit on the qualiti and quantiti of enrich uranium that Iran is allow to keep There seem to be arrang for inspect It s not quit clear whether there s a differ between and when necessari the presid phrase it and anywher but thi is to be determin But all in all what the agreement appear to do is provid fifteen year in which Iran doe not have nuclear weapon
p91

V On the downsid is that signific financi resourc will begin to flow to Iran which they can use for ani and all purpos There is the lift after five year of an arm embargo and after eight year of a missil embargo Iran is allow to keep a lot of nuclear relat capac so thi is a far cri from what the UN and other initi said they want There is the possibl of noncompli But to me the biggest question mark and the biggest concern I have with the agreement is perhap iron not the possibl that Iran may not compli it s my concern over what happen if Iran doe compli
p93
sI93
V You don t think over the next ten year or so we can woo Iran into our Western bosom? I had assum that there is such a build up of interest amongWhat about the Unit State relat with Israel and with it Arab friend in the region? the Iranian middl class that thi Could you comment on a seemingli de facto allianc between Saudi Arabia and Israel? How do you think Obama handl thi whole negotiation? would lead to a warm with I gather from your comment that you regard thi as a lacklust agreement? the Unit State and that onc the current ayatollah pass from the scene that there would be a new open in Iran My concern is that Iran can start prepositioning centrifug after ten year and after fifteen year enrich uranium It could then prepar for a breakout There is noth in the agreement that say what Iran cannot do in ten year on centrifug and fifteen year on enrich uranium It simpli say that the addit protocol and the nonprolifer treati will pertain But there are no ceil on capabl So the real concern I have is less the strateg signific of Iranian noncompli than the strateg signific of Iranian complianc
p94

V There s clearli a hope or belief on the part of mani in the administr appar reinforc by the Iranian foreign minist that thi agreement ha the potenti to do just that To use former U S diplomat Georg Kennan s term some believ thi agreement ha the potenti to lead to a of Iran I call that wish think I can t rule it out I hope it s true But I for one don t see it If anyth the flow of resourc will work in the opposit direct Iran believ it s on someth of a strateg roll So I doubt that will happen But in ani event sinc we can t know I would simpli say it would be a mistak to in ani way defend thi agreement on the basi that it will lead to a chang in Iran s charact or behavior At no point over the durat of thi agreement ought we cut Iran ani slack on the detail of the agreement which affect capabl in the hope that somehow it intent evolv That would be a real mistak
p95

V I can t say you re wrong And I hope you re right But we do have the like success at the ayatollah level You have polit success in the cours of thi agreement You have the power interest group in Iran: cleric the Revolutionari Guard bazaaris and other You have class divis in Iran as we saw in the so call June 2009 revolut So I would again think ye it is quit possibl that some element of Iranian societi in the Iranian polit space will tri to run with thi agreement and to reintegr Iran with the world And I expect other will push back I don t think we can be confid that we know how thi will play out It is even possibl in the short run that mani in Iran s leadership will need to do radic thing simpli to demonstr that they haven t somehow sold out the revolut by sign thi agreement with the Satan So everyon should be care about predict or assum in ani way that thi will lead to a moder of Iran s behavior toward it own citizen or toward it neighbor

V Thi agreement complic U S relat both with Israel and Iran s neighbor Even without thi agreement rebuild trust and confid with Israel would be a prioriti It may be imposs with thi presid given hi relationship with thi particular prime minist of Israel Benjamin Netanyahu Thi might be someth better left to Obama s successor Republican or Democrat But you need to reestablish strateg trust with Israel Becaus it is quit possibl that at variou moment dure thi agreement there will be either real question about Iranian behavior or simpli some veri tough issu in the region: the futur of Jordan stabil of Syria These are the kind of issu that requir veri close U S Isra cooper Just as tough is go to be relat with the Sunni Arab govern who from what I can tell at least in the case of Saudi Arabia seem to be more concern with Iran than with ISI
p97

V I don t necessarili share that strateg view More broadli discourag sever of the Arab regim as well as Turkey from what we might call against the Iranian nuclear program with nuclear program of their own ha got to becom an American strateg prioriti As bad as the Middl East is today one can imagin a situat that is even worse: A Middl East that ha multipl finger on multipl nuclear weapon would be just that
p98
sI98
V My own view is that it is more de facto than a real allianc I think it s overdrawn I m tempt to cite the enemi of your enemi can still be your enemi Just becaus the Isra and Saudi share some concern about Iran it is a bit of a reach that there is necessarili a major strateg overlap between the two countri
p99
sI99
V I have a mix reaction I ve negoti a lot myself So ani time you are will to sustain a difficult negoti that show a lot of stay power and commit it is a plu On the other hand I m concern that in too mani area we compromis more than we should have I would have earlier on establish some posit and gotten the European to sign onto them so they weren t unilater American posit For instanc the durat of thi agreement I still don t understand whi we were content with a ten year limit on centrifug and a fifteen year limit on enrich uranium when the Non Prolifer Treati is open end I would have said either open end constraint on the Iranian nuclear program or at least far longer durat constraint And if the Iranian said no and the Unit State and Europ were togeth on that then we would have been prepar not to have thi agreement So that s one area I don t understand the relax of the arm embargo after five year or the missil embargo after eight It just seem to me that a desir on our part to avoid either a total unconstrain Iran or a war propel us to go further than we should have on some of the compromis There were too mani area where we seem to split the differ rather than insist on someth closer to our posit

p115

p116

V That is not the whole stori howev The nuclear deal bind Barack Obama America s presid into the Middl East Thi is hi foreign polici legaci and he is it enforc in chief just as hi successor will be Iran s is in turmoil roil by jihadists includ Islam State war with Saudi Arabia in Yemen and a fail regim in Syria Extra money will help Iran s effort but as America discov in Iraq domin is not determin by resourc If the Unit State buttress it oversight of the agreement with sustain region diplomaci need anyway after the Arab spring then it can help contain Iran
p135
sI135
V Although the deal will make Iran more power it will also lead the countri to becom more open As in China the Iranian theocraci rule over a popul that long ago lost it revolutionari zeal see articl The regim agre to constrain it nuclear programme becaus again as in China it calcul that it is more like to surviv if Iranian feel that they have a shot at prosper Unlik North Korea s Kim dynasti which cheat on it nuclear pact Iran s suprem leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei decid that be a pariah wa wors for hi regim than rejoin the world
p136
sI136
V That choic onli make sens if Iran can now attract trade and invest The more Iran trade with the rest of the world the more suscept it will grow to intern pressur As the countri becom enmesh in the global economi interest group will emerg within Iran s complex faction polit who will argu that the countri s futur is better serv by decent relat with foreign than by bad one The more Iranian benefit from tie with the outsid world the stronger those moder voic will becom

V There s alreadi a lot of commentari out there on the Iranian nuclear deal offici term the Joint Comprehens Plan of Action or JCPOA and there s sure to be lot more come in the next few day But what doe the deal actual do? You know what s in that veri long and veri dens document the parti have agre to?
p139
sI139
V Iran and the P5+1 US Franc Germani UK China Russia and the EU have been negoti at breakneck speed and understand make the text clear and user friendli wa not a top prioriti for ani of the negoti Much of it is unclear and duplicative and a complic web of intertextual refer and citat make for difficult read
p140
sI140
V Don t worri though: We live to serv Here s a comprehens summari
p141
sI141
V The document begin with a Prefac which is pretti much what you d expect contain veri gener languag about the broad purpos of the JCOPA: to that Iran s nuclear programme will be exclus peac and to the comprehens lift of all UN Secur Council sanction as well as multilater and nation sanction relat to Iran s nuclear programme
p142
sI142
V It next move on to a Preambl Gener Provis which provid the principl that the rest of the agreement s text will fill out: The deal will ensur the peac natur of the Iranian nuclear program and is to be endors by the UN Secur Council Thi UNSC resolut will provid for termin of all UN sanction relat to the the nuclear issu on Day" the day the IAEA certifi Iranian complianc with a subset of it oblig and conclus of UNSC consider of the Iranian nuclear issu a littl over ten year from now on what the deal call with somewhat Schwarzeneggerian overton Day"
p143
sI143
V Iran reaffirm it will never develop or acquir ani nuclear weapon In turn the P5+1 agre that all sanction relat to Iran s nuclear program will be lift and that they will refrain from impos discriminatori regulatori and procedur requir in their place Although Iran is recogn as have all the standard NPT right and oblig of a non nuclear state the agreement s provis stipul that the JCPOA s provis should not be view as preced for interpret intern law agreement or the NPT
p144
sI144
V A Commission" consist of eight member US UK Franc Germani China Russia Iran and the EU will be creat to monitor implement and resolv disput The P5+1 will also meet with Iran at the ministeri level everi two year or earlier if need Addit these same power will cooper with Iran the field of peac use of nuclear energy" and determin civil nuclear cooper project
p145
sI145
V The next section entitl Nuclear togeth with Annex materi that it refer provid the meat of Iran s oblig under the deal
p146
sI146
V With respect to Enrich Enrich R&D Stockpiles" the section requir that there will be agre limitations" on uranium enrich activ and R&D for eight year Afterward Iran s enrich will primarili be bound by voluntari commit that will be submit to IAEA as part of it provision implement of the Addit Protocol thi submiss must occur prior to Implement Day For 15 year all test with uranium and uranium enrich will occur exclus in Natanz and enrich will onli be up to 3 67 percent enough for civilian use Iran s total stockpil of enrich uranium will remain under 300 kg of 3 67 percent and the excess will be sold The agreement also goe into extens detail about how and where variou sort of equip must be store within Natanz
p147
sI147
V For ten year Iran s limit enrich program will continu exclus with 5 060 activ centrifug all of the simplest IR 1 model and all oper in Natanz If ani of these break Iran may replac them with replac of the same model All excess and damag centrifug and equip will be store under continu monitor by the IAEA also at Natanz Dure these ten year Iran can also continu research and develop R&D enrich with exist more advanc centrifug but can onli continu test two of each model For the bulk of these ten year Iran will also be larg restrict from creat more centrifug After eight and a half year these restrict begin to laps The number of activ advanc centrifug jump to thirti and Iran can start produc more to be kept incomplet and under IAEA monitor for the remain year and a half and eventu brought into oper need
p148
sI148
V While all enrich is take place at Natanz Fordow a formerli secret facil reveal by Western intellig in 2009 will be convert into a physic and technolog centre Intern collabor will be establish for joint area of research and the Joint Commiss will be told in advanc of the project that will be pursu there The IAEA will design the amount of uranium that can remain at the plant from past oper and inspector will have daili access to the plant for 15 year
p149
sI149
V Similarli for 15 year no uranium enrich will take place at Fordow and no nuclear materi will be present For the same period onli 1044 IR 1 centrifug in six cascad will remain at Fordow Two of these cascad will spin without uranium and will be transit to stabl isotop product The rest will remain idl All other infrastructur particularli connect and pipework that could allow these centrifug to be use for enrich of weapon grade uranium will be remov and store under IAEA continu monitor at Natanz
p150
sI150
V With respect to Arak Heavi Water and Fuel Reprocess Iran commit to redesign Arak as a modernised heavi water research reactor for industri and medicin research A Work Group of the P5+1 will help with both the redesign and the implement of the redesign includ technic financi support and facilit the sale and transfer of necessari materi although Iran will take the lead The redesign reactor will not produc weapon grade plutonium normal operation" and will minim product of plutonium altogeth The design must be agre on by the Joint Commiss and the IAEA will monitor construct
p151
sI151
V The redesign reactor will use specifi measur of uranium and the fuel design will need to be review and approv by the Joint Commiss Certain exist materi such as natur uranium pellet and IR 40 fuel assembl will be place under continu monitor until they can be convert All spent fuel for the lifetim of the reactor will be ship out of countri The reactor will oper under IAEA monitor
p152
sI152
V For 15 year other than Arak there will be no addit heavi water reactor or accumul of heavi water and all excess heavi water as defin explicitli in the deal will be made avail for export Iran will report on thi to the IAEA which will have access in order to verifi For the same period Iran will not acquir do ani reprocess or relat activ except for a veri specif few Accord to the deal Iran also not intend to thereafter" do so either The forc of thi languag is unclear it also seem less strict the Lausanne languag that ha commit indefinit to not conduct reprocess or reprocess research and develop on spent nuclear fuel
p153
sI153
V The next section lay out a seri of Transpar and Confid Build Measur Over the next few month Iran will provision appli the Addit Protocol allow for increas inspect and fulli implement both modifi code 3 1 oblig Iran to disclos new nuclear facil befor construct start and the Roadmap for Clarif of Past and Present Outstand Issu The IAEA will have to verifi that these as well as other measur have been complet in order to trigger Day
p154
sI154
V In the time frame specifi start on Adopt Day and continu for variou period of between 8 year and 25 year Iran will allow the IAEA to both monitor the implement of the voluntari measur and to implement transpar measur that include:

p158
sI158
V For an unspecifi durat of time Iran also agre not to engag in activ includ at the research and design level that could contribut to the develop of a nuclear explos devic Such activ includ develop or use explos driven neutron sourc or comput model to simul nuclear explos devic Iran also agre to cooper with and act in accord with the procur channel specifi in the JCPOA i e under the oversight and approv of the Joint Commiss when obtain certain sensit nuclear relat materi
p159
sI159
V Those are Iran s oblig under the agreement Here s what Iran get in return The main benefit involv Sanction relief On Implement Day i e simultan with IAEA verif that Iran ha met certain preliminari oblig the UN Secur Council will all sanction relat to the Iranian nuclear issu impos from from 2006 2015 Similarli the EU will termin all of it econom and financi sanction and US sanction waiver and suspens will take effect Thi wave of relief will includ suspens of sanction relat to:
p160
sI160
V financi bank and transact with Iranian institut
p161
sI161
V After eight year or when the IAEA reach the Broader Conclus whichev is earlier the EU will termin all prolifer relat sanction and the US will termin or modifi sanction prevent Iran s acquir nuclear relat commod and servic translation: ballist missil At thi time the US s approach to Iran s nuclear activ must be consist with the U S approach to other non nuclear weapon state The Unit State must also make everi effort to encourag offici at the state or local level to take into account the chang in the U S polici and to lift their own sanction regim
p162
sI162
V Both the Unit State and the EU will refrain from re introduc or re impos the sanction that they termin as a result of the JCPOA There will also be no new nuclear relat UN Secur Council sanction and no new EU or U S sanction Presum the US and EU could still impos new even ident sanction on Iranian individu or institut for reason unrel to the nuclear program e g an upsurg in Iranian support for terror
p163
sI163
V Crucial howev the agreement also recogn that ha state that it will treat such a re introduct or re imposit of the sanction as ground to ceas perform it commit under thi JCPOA in whole or in part Thi seem to acknowledg that as long as Iran compli with the deal the US and EU will like be veri hesit to impos new sanction irrespect of other behavior
p164
sI164
V The EU EU Member State and US will also issu clear public guidanc about the sanction relief and will refrain from ani polici intend to advers affect the normal of trade and econom relat with Iran They commit to engag in joint project with Iran includ through IAEA cooper project in the field of peac nuclear technolog These joint project include: nuclear power plant research reactor fuel fabric agre joint advanc R&D such as fusion establish of a region nuclear medic center personnel train nuclear safeti and secur and environment protect Iran and these countri will also agre on step to ensur Iran s access in area of trade technolog financ and energi
p165
sI165
V The deal then lay out an Implement Plan which list the five for implement of JCPOA commitments:
p166
sI166
V Final Day: The day the agreement is reach and is endors by Iran and the P5+1: Juli 14 2015 The deal is submit to the UNSC and the EU Council and Iran and the IAEA begin work on transpar arrang Particip in the agreement will necessari arrang and preparations" to implement their commit on Day
p167
sI167
V Adopt Day: 90 day after the UNSC vote to endors the JCPOA pass resolut that will on Implement Day lift all nuclear relat sanction on Iran Adopt Day can also come earlier by mutual agreement of the parti Iran provision appli the Addit Protocol allow for increas inspect fulli implement modifi code 3 1 oblig Iran to disclos new nuclear facil befor construct start and provid certain inform in write to the IAEA about issu The EU and US Presid will pass those regul and issu those waiver necessari to begin sanction relief on Implement Day Iran and the P5+1 begin discuss on a document defin their respect role in the transit of the Arak Heavi Water Reactor
p168
sI168
V Implement Day: The day the IAEA certifi that Iran ha conform to a specifi signific subset of it oblig e g implement chang at Arak cap enrich capac provision implement the Addit Protocol etc Simultan with the IAEA certif previous issu EU regul UN Secur Council resolut and US presidenti waiver will take effect provid Iran with sweep sanction relief Sanction that expir on Implement Day include: restrict on bank transfer loan insur US currenc trade oil ga transport ship and metal design individu and compani and automobil
p169
sI169
V Transit Day: Either 8 year after Adopt Day or when the IAEA and UNSC reach the Conclusion" that Iran s nuclear program is entir peac whichev is first Iran will parliamentari ratif and therebi formal the Addit Protocol The US will legisl action to lift remain sanction particularli under the Iran North Korea and Syria Nonprolifer Act on the acquisit of nuclear relat commod and servic for nuclear activ contempl in the JCPOA The EU will also lift further sanction in particular sensit nuclear activities" i e sanction relat to ballist missil
p170
sI170
V Termin Day: 10 year from Adopt Day The UN Secur Resolut endors the JCPOA will termin The EU will termin all remain sanction
p171
sI171
V The agreement also contain a Disput Resolut Mechan Under the mechan both Iran and ani member of the P5+1 can refer complaint over the other side s not meet it JCPOA commit to the Joint Commiss The Joint Commiss would have 15 day to resolv the issu unless time period wa extend by consensu If the Joint Commiss fail to resolv the issu the issu could be refer to of Foreign Affair who would also have 15 day to resolv Either altern to or simultan with the Minist of Foreign Affair stage the issu could also be refer to an Advisori Board consist of three member one appoint by each parti in the disput and one appoint by an independ parti The Board would also have 15 day to review the disput If the disput remain unresolv the Joint Commiss will have five day to review the opinion of the Board and attempt to resolv the issu
p172
sI172
V If the issu is still unresolv after thi process the parti bring the complaint can ceas perform it commit under the JCPOA or notifi the UN Secur Council that the other parti is involv in non perform The UN Secur Council would then have 30 day to vote on whether to continu lift sanction Unless it adopt a resolut to continu sanction relief provis of the old UN Secur Council Resolut initi lift on Implement Day would be re impos The Secur Council will into account" the view of the state involv in the disput and of the Advisori Board
p173
sI173
V There seem to be some inartful languag here impli that the UNSC might both fail to pass a resolut on continu sanction lift and prevent sanction to be reinstated: the resolut describ abov continu sanction suspens ha not been adopt within 30 day of the notif then the provis of the old UN Secur Council resolut would be re impos unless the UN Secur Council decid otherwis Thi last claus is either duplicative or is referenc some other unforeseen action
p174
sI174
V Final the text onc again acknowledg omin that ha state that if sanction are reinstat in whole or in part Iran will treat that as ground to ceas perform it commit under thi JCPOA in whole or in part
p175
sI175
V After the main text the agreement contain a number of annex which expand upon the compon of the main text ANNEX I: NUCLEAR RELAT MEASUR offer a myriad of technic detail about limit on Iran s nuclear activ storag of it equip and IAEA inspect It provid detail about the develop and storag of centrifug the convers of reactor limit on enrich and more we have includ much of thi inform abov It also detail Iran s respons to begin implement the Addit Protocol Modifi Code 3 1 and the for Clarif of Past and Present Outstand Issu
p176
sI176
V Some of the annex s most crucial section concern the IAEA s presenc and capabl within Iran 15 year or longer Iran will allow the IAEA to use technologies" such as line enrich measurement" and will allow the instal of automat measur devic that will updat IAEA inspector on nuclear site Iran will also facilit a term IAEA presence" through the provis of visa and work space Within nine month of Implement Day Iran will increas the total number of IAEA inspector allow within Iran to between 130 and 150 For 25 year Iran also guarante the IAEA the abil to monitor and verifi the use of uranium ore For 15 year it guarante the IAEA monitoring" of store materi in Natanz For 20 year Iran will take specifi necessari step contain and surveil on centrifug rotor tube and bellows" that Iran is keep it agreement to limit uranium isotop separ relat research and activ to specifi method for 10 year
p177
sI177
V The annex also specifi the process by which the IAEA deal with question and suspicions: If the IAEA becom concern regard nuclear materi or activ or activ inconsist with the JCPOA the Agenc must notifi Iran of it concern at which point Iran will have the opportun to offer an explan If the IAEA isn t satisfi it can request access to the site in question and list the reason for access write though Iran may propos altern mean of resolv the problem If the side are not abl to reach agreement over access within 14 day of the IAEA s origin request Iran will consult the Joint Commiss to resolv the issu The Joint Commiss will have seven day to reach a conclus which Iran will then have three day to implement
p178
sI178
V Note that the Joint Commiss can on the necessari means" to resolv the disput either by consensu or by a vote of 5 out of 8 member which mean that the Commiss would be abl to reach a conclus even if Russia China and Iran dissent The annex also specifi that IAEA request for access must be made good faith with due observ of the sovereign right of Iran to the minimum necessari and not be aim at interf with Iranian militari or other nation secur activ
p179
sI179
V A final section bar Iran from particip in activ that could to the construct of a nuclear bomb: develop or use comput model to nuclear weapon develop point explos deton systems" unless approv by the Joint Commiss develop diagnost systems" or driven neutron sourc These prohibit are of unspecifi durat
p180
sI180
V Lastli the annex includ an extens design" for the redesign and reconstruct of Arak as a heavi water research reactor Thi outlin will provid the basi for the redesign that will be approv by the Joint Commiss and implement by Iran

V Got all that? There will be a short quiz next period
p188
sI188
V An atom bomb can be made from two type of radioact materials: uranium or plutonium The talk were aim at curb Iran s abil to put these two element to use in weapon In each case the manufactur start with uranium ore Uranium mine from the earth is less than 1 percent U 235 the isotop that can be use to fuel reactor and make bomb Centrifug are need to separ the U 235 from the rest of the uranium in a process call enrich The other fuel that can be use to make a bomb plutonium is made by irradi uranium in a nuclear reactor The process transform some of the uranium into plutonium
p189
sI189
V Dure the enrich process centrifug are use to rais concentr of U 235 For most power reactor in the West uranium is enrich up to 5 percent Bomb grade is abov 90 percent and Iran had been process ore to 20 percent enrich The agreement Iran ha agre to transform it deepli buri plant at Fordo into a center for scienc research Anoth uranium plant Natanz is to be cut back rather than shut down Some 5 000 centrifug for enrich uranium will remain spin there about half the current number Iran ha also agre to limit enrich to 3 7 percent and to cap it stockpil of low enrich uranium at 300 kilogram or 660 pound for 15 year That is consid insuffici for a bomb rush
p190
sI190
V Iran wa construct a nuclear reactor at Arak that would have use natur uranium to produc Pu 239 which can fuel bomb The agreement Iran ha agre to redesign and rebuild the Arak reactor so it will not produc weapon grade plutonium The origin core of the reactor which would enabl the product of weapon grade plutonium will be made inoper but will stay in the countri Under the term of the deal the reactor s spent fuel which could also be use to produc a bomb will be ship out of the countri Iran will not build ani addit heavi water reactor for 15 year
p191
sI191
V More than twice the size of Texa in area Iran pose mani challeng for atom inspector who have to polic the agreement and gain access not onli to scientist lab and factori but also to mani underground site and militari base Western alli say the new inspect must be far more intrus than those in the past given the deal s sweep term as well as Iran s histori of evas stonewal and illicit procurements The princip concern are how to detect cheat and covert site The agreement Iran ha agre to provid the Intern Atom Energi Agenc greater access and inform regard it nuclear program and to allow the agenc to investig suspici site or alleg of covert facil relat to uranium enrich anywher in the countri Inspector will also have access to the suppli chain that support Iran s nuclear program includ uranium mine and mill and to continu surveil of centrifug manufactur and storag facil
p192
sI192
V The deal requir Iran to reduc it current stockpil of low enrich uranium by 98 percent and limit Iran s enrich capac and research and develop for 15 year Some inspect and transpar measur will remain in place for as long as 25 year Accord to Presid Obama: relief will be phase in Iran must complet key nuclear step befor it begin to receiv sanction relief Sanction for arm could be lift in five year ballist missil in eight

V Yet it left open area that are sure to rais fierc object in Congress It preserv Iran s abil to produc as much nuclear fuel as it wish after year 15 of the agreement and allow it to conduct research on advanc centrifug after the eighth year Moreov the Iranian won the eventu lift of an embargo on the import and export of convent arm and ballist missil a step the depart chairman of the Joint Chief of Staff Gen Martin E Dempsey warn about just last week
p202
sI202
V American offici said the core of the agreement secur in 18 consecut day of talk here lie in the restrict on the amount of nuclear fuel that Iran can keep for the next 15 year The current stockpil of low enrich uranium will be reduc by 98 percent most like by ship much of it to Russia
p203
sI203
V That limit combin with a two third reduct in the number of it centrifug would extend to a year the amount of time it would take Iran to make enough materi for a singl bomb should it abandon the accord and race for a weapon what offici call time By comparison analyst say Iran now ha a breakout time of two to three month
p204

V In come week as Congress and the American public evalu the Iran nuclear deal other more controversi aspect of the JCPOA the battleground issu are like to command the main focu of what promis to be a knock down drag out fight
p241
sI241
V 1 What happen to Iran s nuclear program after the deal s first decade?
p242
sI242
V An issu like to receiv much attent deservedli so is what happen in the years" the later year of the deal when some key restrict on Iran s enrich capac begin to expir JCPOA limit will ensur that at least for 10 year Iran would need at least one year to produc enough weapon grade uranium to build a bomb if it decid to breach the agreement But as Iran becom free to increas the number of oper centrifug and introduc more advanc type after 10 year and to increas it enrich level and stock of enrich uranium after 15 year breakout time will decreas and eventu shrink to a matter of week leav Iran with a nuclear weapon capabl Critic assert that allow Iran to ramp up it enrich capac in the years" mean that the deal mere postpon but doe not prevent a nuclear arm Iran
p243
sI243
V There are two separ year" issu The first is how rapidli Iran can increas it enrich capac and therebi shorten breakout time in the second decad of the agreement The second is whether Iran can be prevent from build nuclear weapon onc the breakout time is reduc to a few week
p244
sI244
V On the first issu sever element of the nuclear deal will imped Iran s abil to rapidli boost it enrich capac Strict limit on research and develop in the first 10 year will requir Iran to do further R&D on advanc centrifug after 10 year delay the time those machin could be deploy and oper Moreov maintain the 300 kilogram cap on enrich uranium stock and the 3 67 percent cap on enrich level for 15 year will further slow the rate at which breakout time will decreas between year 10 and 15
p245
sI245
V Also import as part of it oblig under the Addit Protocol Iran will submit a plan to the IAEA thi fall indic the rate at which it will increas it enrich program up to year 14 includ ani plan for introduc more advanc centrifug Under the JCPOA Iran commit itself to abid by that plan The P5+1 countri are awar of the plan s key element which have been brief in confid to Congress Reportedli the plan indic that Iran will increas it enrich program at a gradual pace not race to an industri scale capabl that it leader describ as their goal
p246
sI246
V On the basi of these factor it is expect that at least until year 14 breakout time will be significantli greater than it is at present perhap in the neighborhood of half a year If Iran encount technic problem in develop or manufactur advanc centrifug which would not be surpris given the difficulti it experienc with the IR 1 first gener machin breakout time will declin more slowli
p247
sI247
V Still whatev the rate of declin at some point like between year 15 and 20 Iran will be abl to increas enrich capac suffici to lower breakout time to a few week At that point the question becom whether Iran can be prevent from make the decis to cross the threshold and build nuclear weapon
p248
sI248
V Critic argu that onc Iran ha gotten that close to the nuclear threshold it will have a clear path ahead to nuclear weapon and will almost sure embark on that path at a time of it choos But it is far from certain that Iran s leader have paid the huge price of devast sanction and intern isol for pursu nuclear weapon would judg that nuclear arm are a nation imper Much would depend on how at the time they view their region secur environ whether they thought their nation aspir could be met without nuclear weapon and how they perceiv other nation would react to their deceit in violat their intern oblig and declar religi principl
p249
sI249
V The idea that Iran ultim may not opt for nuclear weapon is consist with repeat assess by the U S intellig commun Sinc 2007 the intellig commun ha judg that while Iran s leader have kept open the option to pursu nuclear weapon they have not made the decis to do so
p250
sI250
V But even if Iranian leader after 15 year or more believ their nation interest were best serv by have nuclear weapon they would run major risk in go forward with no guarante of success Even in the out year the JCPOA s rigor monitor arrang will remain in forc The world will have gain intim knowledg of Iran s nuclear program which would give the Unit State prompt warn of ani Iranian effort to make a dash for the bomb Even if breakout time had declin to a few week the Unit State would like have suffici time to interven militarili to stop them And dure the preced year the Unit State will have pursu more effect intellig mean to discov and more effect militari mean to thwart ani Iranian movement toward build the bomb
p251
sI251
V It would have been prefer to have perman or longer term restrict on Iran s enrich program to preserv a one year breakout time well beyond 15 year But prevent a nuclear arm Iran is possibl without longer last restrict provid the Unit State and key partner maintain a strong and credibl deterr against a futur Iranian decis to go for the bomb To that end current and futur U S presid explicitli support by Congress should declar that it is U S polici to prevent Iran from acquir nuclear weapon and that the Unit State will use ani necessari mean includ militari forc to enforc that polici
p252
sI252
V 2 How doe the deal address concern about the possibl militari dimens of Iran s past nuclear work?
p253
sI253
V Anoth battleground issu involv persist IAEA effort long frustrat by Iranian stonewal to gain a better understand of past Iranian research experiment and procur believ to be relat to the develop of nuclear weapon On Juli 14 2015 Iran and the IAEA agre on a aim at resolv all outstand issu relat to the militari dimensions" PMD of Iran s nuclear program The roadmap provid for expert meetings" and measures" presum IAEA interview with Iranian scientist and IAEA access to document and certain site Those agre activ all of which are to be complet by Octob 15 are contain in separ confidenti agreement By Decemb 15 the IAEA director gener will provid hi final assess of the PMD issu to the agenc s board of governor and the U N Secur Council
p254
sI254
V Iran s complet of all agre roadmap step by Octob 15 is a prerequisit along with Iran s implement of sever other nuclear relat commit for the suspens of U S EU and U N sanction The confidenti natur of Iran s roadmap step reflect the IAEA s standard practic of confidenti on safeguard matter but thi ha understand caus a stir on Capitol Hill especi becaus sanction relief depend on fulfil of those step
p255
sI255
V The IAEA s profession judgment is that implement of the agre step would provid the agenc what it need to gain an adequ understand of the PMD issu But U S legisl want to make their own evalu of those step befor cast vote on the JCPOA Administr offici appar are not in possess of the detail IAEA Iran arrang although they are awar of the key element To address legitim congression concern they have confidenti brief those element to member Moreov the Senat Foreign Relat Committe held a close door session with IAEA Director Gener Yukiya Amano on August 5 to discuss the roadmap
p256
sI256
V Implement of the roadmap may well give the IAEA greater insight into past Iranian activ than it ha gain to date But even if Iran take the formal step requir by the roadmap grant the requir access to scientist document and site it is hard to imagin that Iranian cooper with the IAEA will be suffici forthcom or that Iranian respons to IAEA question will be suffici complet and truth to give the IAEA a full understand of those activ As a result the director gener s Decemb report is like to be inconclus indic progress in clarifi certain issu but note question and concern that remain It may say on the one hand that the agenc is unawar of evid that weaponization activ continu but on the other that it cannot conclud that past activ were not nuclear weapon relat
p257
sI257
V Clearli such an outcom of the PMD issu would not be veri satisfi But a full and honest disclosur by Iran of it past weaponization activ which would contradict Tehran s narr of an exclus peac program as well the suprem leader s fatwa that Islam forbid nuclear weapon wa never in the card The key question is whether the absenc of a full Iranian confess regard it past activ is a seriou obstacl to achiev confid that Iran is not pursu nuclear weapon go forward
p258
sI258
V The answer to thi question will be vigor debat Howev consid the rang of tool we will have for prevent a nuclear arm Iran includ but not limit to those provid in the JCPOA the failur to achiev full knowledg of the past doe not repres a critic defici
p259
sI259
V The JCPOA contain a number of provis that can help deter and prevent futur weaponization activ Correct a seriou omiss in the Non Prolifer Treati it explicitli commit Iran not to engag in a rang of specif activ relat to the develop of nuclear weapon includ certain work in uranium and plutonium metallurgi nuclear explos model research on explos deton and neutron initi system and procur of special equip for those purpos In addit Secur Council restrict on import sensit technolog for militari end use togeth with the consensu approv procedur for the procur channel set up to allow nuclear and dual use item for peac purpos will imped Iranian attempt to import materi and equip relev to weaponization And the deal s provis that ensur IAEA access to ani locat in Iran where illicit activ are suspect of take place discuss below can play a role albeit a modest one in discourag futur nuclear weapon relat activ
p260
sI260
V In addit to the tool provid in the agreement the intern commun will need to reli heavili on nation intellig capabl especi those of the Unit State and it foreign partner to discov ani futur work on weaponization Inde what we know about Iran s past weapon relat activ come primarili from Western intellig sourc Keep the Iran nuclear issu near the top of U S intellig prioriti may be the most promis way to address weaponization go forward
p261
sI261
V Some observ have argu that full knowledg of past activ is necessari to design an effect verif system for the futur But the relev of activ over 12 year ago to devis today s monitor arrang is not clear Would the Iranian return to the same site they use for weaponization activ previously? Would futur weapon relat activ be confin to the same personnel who particip before?
p262
sI262
V More fundament the challeng of detect small scale weaponization work is much greater than the challeng of monitor higher profil less easili conceal activ relat to the product of fissil materi With or without full knowledg of the past it is hard to imagin reach agreement on monitor arrang intrus enough to provid confid that Iran ha no ongo weaponization activ For exampl among the measur that could be help in provid such confid would be arrang for close and frequent keep track of the activ of Iranian scientist with the necessari expertis or for verifi on site the end use of equip throughout Iran that could be use in nuclear weapon design and diagnost
p263
sI263
V Howev such intrus arrang are simpli unrealist No sovereign state will permit that level of extern scrutini Full knowledg of past Iranian activ would not make it ani easier to persuad Tehran to accept such monitor That is whi deter weaponization activ must depend less on agre monitor measur and more on intellig capabl procur restrict and the threat of harsh penalti for violat
p264
sI264
V Some analyst argu that in order to calcul how much time we would have to interven and thwart an Iranian attempt to break out and build nuclear weapon we need to know how much progress Iran made in it past weaponization effort and that thi requir full disclosur by Iran of it past activ But whi would we depend on Iranian account of how far they had progress especi when they would have incent to mislead us most like to underst how far they had gotten?
p265
sI265
V From our own sourc we alreadi have consider knowledg of past Iranian activ not knowledge" as U S Secretari of State John Kerri claim in a recent misstat but a signific amount Moreov in calcul the time avail to thwart an Iranian breakout attempt we would have to make the conserv assumpt that Iran had made major headway on weaponization and that go from the product of weapon grade uranium to the fabric of a workabl nuclear weapon would not be a signific challeng It is unlik that anyth Iranian scientist might tell the IAEA about activ befor 2003 when dedic weaponization research is believ to have been suspend would affect U S plan for interrupt an Iranian dash for nuclear weapon
p266
sI266
V It would certainli be prefer for Iran to come clean on it past weaponization work not becaus it would have much practic util in devis the agreement s monitor measur or in plan to thwart a possibl futur breakout but becaus an admiss of past nuclear weapon intent would provid greater confid that Iran had made a strateg decis to abandon ani aspir to acquir nuclear arm Unfortun Iran will not come clean and that will perpetu concern about it intent
p267
sI267
V Still with vigor enforc of the JCPOA aggress intellig gather and the credibl threat of forc intervent in the event of an Iranian breakout attempt it is possibl to deter Iran from exercis the option to build nuclear weapon even if the outcom on the PMD issu is less than fulli satisfactori And if Iran s implement of the PMD roadmap doe not allay IAEA concern and lead to an inconclus report in Decemb the PMD file should stay open over the next sever year as the IAEA consid the conclusion" on whether Iran s nuclear program is exclus peac the conclus that would provid the basi for a futur U S administr to ask Congress to termin not just suspend statutori sanction
p268
sI268
V 3 Is IAEA access to sensit site time enough?
p269
sI269
V Anoth battleground issu that ha gain promin in recent week is whether the JCPOA s provis on IAEA access to suspect site beyond those declar site that will be subject to continu verif can effect deter and detect covert violat of the agreement The text of the agreement ha larg put to rest concern that the IAEA might be deni access to such suspect site concern heighten by statement from Iran s suprem leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei that access to militari site would cross one of hi redlines The JCPOA s provis for resolv access disput under which a Joint Commiss can by major vote requir Iran to grant access or face the Secur Council s restor of sanction provid assur that Tehran cannot get away with block access to ani locat in the countri
p270
sI270
V The main controversi on access involv the question of whether IAEA inspector will be admit to suspect facil in a time fashion in particular whether they will gain access befor Iran is abl to hide or remov evid of illicit activ Although the IAEA Addit Protocol doe not establish a time limit after which parti are requir to admit inspector the P5+1 insist on impos one on Iran in the JCPOA It provid for a maximum of 24 day from the time the IAEA request access to the time Iran must acced to a Joint Commiss decis to provid access In a breakout scenario the time limit would prevent the Iranian from stall indefinit in the hope of buy time for breakout activ to advanc befor the Unit State or other could interven to stop them
p271
sI271
V Critic argu that 24 day would give Iran plenti of opportun to elimin incrimin evid befor inspector can arriv either by simpli move equip or materi to anoth locat or scrub the facil of ani physic trace of illicit activ
p272
sI272
V Support of the agreement point out that it would not be possibl in 24 day to hide evid of covert product facil such as convers and enrich plant or centrifug manufactur workshop or other rel larg object such as a high explos chamber Moreov they maintain that sophist environment sampl technolog would have a good chanc of detect microscop trace of covert activ if uranium or other nuclear materi were involv even long after 24 day And they argu that as soon as the IAEA request an inspect U S intellig asset would focu on the suspect site and be abl to identifi sign that incrimin cleanup effort were underway
p273
sI273
V The critic are right that remov and cleanup effort could be success complet within 24 day in the case of small scale illicit activ especi if no nuclear materi are involv Moreov although intellig asset have in the past detect effort to sanit site notabl at Iran s Parchin facil detect of such effort cannot be count on in all instanc
p274
sI274
V In the absenc of no notic surpris inspect which have onli been achiev in a case like Iraq where the Secur Council wa in a posit to dictat term to a defeat countri no inspect system can reliabl ensur on site confirm of small scale non nuclear activ Even a system requir access to be grant in a week or even sever day which some of the critic advoc could not provid such assur The inspect system establish under the JCPOA is not perfect but it is time enough to prevent the remov or conceal of incrimin evid of the kind of illicit activ that would be of greatest concern and would most significantli lessen Iran s breakout time
p275
sI275
V Moreov respond to Iranian violat need not depend on proof gather by the IAEA on site While an IAEA inspect that catch Iran red hand would probabl provid the strongest basi for go to the Secur Council and re impos sanction the Unit State would not need to wait for IAEA confirm of Iranian cheat If the Unit State acquir reliabl intellig of Iranian violat that pose a seriou secur threat and could be share with other the nuclear deal enabl Washington to go directli to the Secur Council without wait for IAEA access Inde depend on the scale and time urgenc of the threat the Unit State could choos to act on it own to penal Iran
p276
sI276
V Inspect are onli one compon of the JCPOA s comprehens monitor system Continu surveil of the entir nuclear suppli chain includ the prohibit of sensit import other than those individu approv and monitor for legitim purpos will make it difficult for Iran to pursu an undetect covert enrich program To succeed a covert program requir not just a singl clandestin site but a substanti number of effect hidden facil and undetect movement of equip and materi between them It requir unaccount for or success divert suppli of uranium ore process uranium uranium ga centrifug compon and facil design to produc those suppli The JCPOA s layer monitor system will greatli increas the likelihood of detect one or more of the necessari element of a covert program and provid a substanti deterr to Iranian cheat
p277
sI277
V anytime" inspect were never a possibl But the approach to inspect outlin in the nuclear deal can prevent extend foot drag facilit IAEA confirm of violat that cannot be rapidli cover up and heighten the perceiv risk to Iran of cheat all of which make a signific contribut to the JCPOA s overal verif system
p278
sI278
V 4 What is the signific of restrict on convent arm transfer and ballist missil activities?
p279
sI279
V An issu that wa onli resolv in the final day of negoti and ha becom controversi sinc then is the question of restrict on Iran s export and import of convent arm and on it ballist missil program These restrict were part of the Secur Council sanction in place prior to the conclus of the JCPOA Iran support by Russia and China press for elimin them at the same time other Secur Council sanction are remov but the Unit State insist on preserv them in a new council resolut A compromis wa reach on their durat with the convent arm embargo last five more year and the ballist missil restrict last eight more year
p280
sI280
V The origin Secur Council restrict were adopt as punish for Iran s violat of it nuclear oblig and as an induc to negoti a nuclear deal The restrict were not intend to be perman their termin wa link to an agreement that would provid confid in the peac natur of Iran s nuclear program Given that realiti and strong pressur for immedi repeal by Iran Russia and China it wa a signific accomplish to have preserv the restrict at all
p281
sI281
V Critic have attack the expir of the restrict after five and eight year They maintain that onc the restrict end Iran will be free dramat to increas it militari capabl and threaten it neighbor Moreov the Iranian have made clear that even dure the five year and eight year period they will not consid themselv bound by the renew convent arm and ballist missil constraint just as they did not consid themselv bound by the origin Secur Council restrict which they term illeg They say they are onli commit to compli with their commit under the JCPOA and have given everi indic that they will disregard and seek to circumv the renew council restrict
p282
sI282
V But even though the convent arm and ballist missil restrict have finit durations and even though Iran ha no intent to compli with them they are well worth have They will prevent Tehran from use the plu billion in previous frozen oil revenu that will be releas under the JCPOA to go on a buy spree next year for advanc convent weaponri and ballist missil technolog Although Iran will seek to evad the renew restrict Russia and China vote for them and togeth with other U N member will be bound to enforc them Although the arm embargo doe not cover all categori of arm air defens system such as the S 300 are not includ neither Russia nor China is expect to sell Iran the weapon that are cover such as high perform aircraft
p283
sI283
V Dure the five and eight year repriev on the termin of the restrict the Unit State and it partner will have time to strengthen their region convent militari and missil defens capabl To maintain the qualit advantag current held by Israel and sever Gulf Arab state Congress should approv propos arm sale to the Gulf Arab and pass a new 10 year Memorandum of Understand MOU for militari assist to Israel which should includ addit fund for the develop and deploy of the next stage of the Arrow ballist missil defens system
p284
sI284
V The continu of convent arm and missil restrict will also provid intern legitimaci to effort by the Unit State and other to interdict shipment and stop transact that violat the restrict Should the Unit State receiv intellig or other inform about Iranian attempt to procur arm or technolog illicitli or to export arm of ani categori to it proxi it will have the Secur Council s continu author to take step to block such transfer and it can call on other U N member to cooper in enforc the Council s mandat restrict
p285
sI285
V Even after the renew Secur Council restrict expir the Unit State will have other legal author and polici tool to address Iranian arm transfer to it proxi and import of sensit technolog Exist U N embargo on transfer to Hezbollah the Yemeni Houthis and Shiit milit in Iraq requir U N member to prevent prohibit transfer from or through their territori Other avail polici tool includ the Prolifer Secur Initi which facilit intern cooper in interdict illicit transfer U S sanction law which target certain Iranian convent arm and missil activ and the Missil Technolog Control Regim which coordin the missil export polici of the major missil suppli govern includ Russia

V 5 What are the implic of sanction relief includ releas of plu billion in restrict assets?
p287
sI287
V The nuclear deal s provis on sanction relief have gener mani import question includ whether relief would be condit on Iran s perform whether major and earli relief would forfeit too much leverag need to incentivize continu Iranian complianc whether sanction can be restor in the event of non complianc and whether Iran will be penal for behavior outsid the nuclear realm
p288
sI288
V Obama administr offici have address mani of these question not to the full satisfact of the deal s critic but enough to allay some of the most seriou concern They have point out that under the nuclear deal:
p289
sI289
V Sanction relief will follow not preced Iran s implement of key nuclear commit
p290
sI290
V Exist sanction for non nuclear relat Iranian behavior e g support for terror human right abus will remain in forc and addit sanction can be impos includ on entiti no longer sanction for nuclear reason
p291
sI291
V A substanti number of entiti on the U S sanction list will remain on the list for eight year or indefinit includ the Iranian Revolutionari Guard Corp IRGC and it region arm the Quds Forc and variou militari and missil entiti
p292
sI292
V Foreign bank and other entiti deal with those that remain on the sanction list will be subject to be cut off from the U S financi system
p293
sI293
V U S sanction can be restor in a matter of day if Iran violat it commit and Secur Council sanction can be snap back automat within 30 day if a singl JCPOA parti charg Iran with signific non perform of it commit
p294
sI294
V Entiti that legal enter into contract befor the snap back of Secur Council sanction will be subject to sanction if they do not stop or wind down the implement of ani such contract cover by the restor sanction Contrari to an impress creat by convolut languag in the JCPOA text those contract will not be grandfath
p295
sI295
V Although the JCPOA clearli provid for snap back legitim question remain about whether busi and govern will conscienti go along with the re imposit of sanction especi if they have establish a strong commerci or polit stake in remain engag with Iran Much will depend on the serious of the Iranian violat that trigger the re imposit and the strength of the evid that a violat had been commit Strong shareable evid of major violat such as breakout prepar would facilit the reassembl of the intern sanction coalit Weaker evid or less seriou infract would make it harder
p296
sI296
V The Obama administr should engag now with key intern partner to sensit them to the possibl futur need to restor sanction in whole or in part and to develop procedur and conting plan for do so It should build support for rigor enforc of complianc from the outset address and resolv promptli the inevit implement problem that will aris and not allow even minor violat of the JCPOA to proceed without an appropri firm respons
p297
sI297
V One sanction relief issu that remain highli controversi is what the Iranian will do with the oil revenu held in restrict oversea bank account that will be releas to them on day when the major tranch of nuclear relat sanction will be suspend Critic of the nuclear deal both at home and abroad regard the releas fund somewher in the neighborhood of billion as a windfal that will enabl Iran to devot substanti addit resourc to destabil it neighbor and expand it region influenc includ by boost assist to it proxi and alli in Lebanon Syria Iraq Bahrain Gaza and Yemen and strengthen the capabl of the IRGC s Quds Forc They note that unlik the abil to revers the suspens of most other sanction the previous frozen asset onc releas will be unrecover

V The administr ha tri to minim the potenti advers effect of the releas fund In a hear of the Senat Foreign Relat Committe on Juli 23 U S Treasuri Secretari Jack Lew point out that of the roughli billion in releas fund about half are alreadi commit to meet outstand oblig includ payment to China for infrastructur project leav Tehran with approxim billion not yet spoken for Administr offici have maintain that Iran will like give prioriti to the huge expenditur need for rehabilit it economi which Lew said would requir well over billion in press invest requir and govern oblig
p299

V Administr offici also point out that for the IRGC the organ mani critic believ will be a major beneficiari from releas asset sanction relief will be a mix bless While it may gain access to addit fund it will also like lose out on profit deriv from it control over the black market for sanction good and sector at least part of the explan whi the IRGC oppos the nuclear deal
p300
sI300
V Still the releas of the restrict asset clearli pose risk Even if onli half the releas billion is uncommit and even if the lion s share of those uncommit fund will go to address Iran s econom woe which seem like a veri safe assumpt even a small fraction of the releas asset could make a signific differ if alloc to support Tehran s aggress region behavior includ arm and fund proxi like Hezbollah and the Assad regim in Syria Thi is the sourc of deep concern among America s Gulf Arab friend and Israel
p301
sI301
V The most effect U S respons to the risk pose by the releas asset is not to scuttl the deal or to tri to re negoti a phase or substanti delay releas which given the prioriti the Iranian attach to earli recoveri of the fund would have littl chanc of success Instead Washington should work with it partner to counter Iranian provoc That mean step up interdictions of illicit arm shipment strengthen counter terror effort includ imped and sanction terror financ build up the capac of America s friend and in gener demonstr U S resolv to play a strong leadership role in the region includ oppos Tehran s aggress region design
p302
sI302
V Critic of the nuclear deal are correct that noth in the JCPOA prevent Iran from continu to engag in destabil region behavior By the same token noth prevent the Unit State and it partner from counter that behavior includ by impos sanction not remov by the JCPOA and by employ a wide rang of avail polici tool to counter terror and illicit arm traffick Moreov while the releas asset will put addit resourc at Tehran s dispos those fund are much more than offset by the substanti greater resourc that the Unit State and it Gulf Arab partner can bring to bear to address the region challeng pose by Iran

V 6 What are the consequ of reject the deal?
p305
sI305
V As a congression vote on the JCPOA near the debat over the consequ of disapprov will intensifi The administr argu that in the event of reject the U S led sanction regim would unravel the Unit State would be isol as the spoiler Iran would quickli build up it nuclear capabl and prospect for a militari confront would increas Oppon of the deal paint a much rosier scenario: The Unit State would build support for stronger sanction member of the intern sanction coalit would stick togeth in the hope of get negoti back on track prevent confront and avoid the imposit of sanction on their own firm the Iranian would continu the interim freez on their nuclear program and befor long negoti would resum and a better deal would be conclud
p306
sI306
V Of cours we can onli specul on the consequ of reject But avail evid suggest that the like outcom would be closer to the administr s predict although not quit as rapid or precari
p307
sI307
V Should Congress pass a joint resolut disapprov the nuclear deal and then overrid Obama s promis veto the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act INARA would prevent the presid from issu the waiver need to implement the U S commit under the JCPOA to suspend U S sanction nullifi a central element of the deal and preemptiv remov the incent for Iran to begin implement it nuclear commit Under the JCPOA the suspens of U S sanction is suppos to take place after Iran ha fulfil key nuclear commit most like not until earli 2016
p308
sI308
V More immedi congression reject would prevent the presid from continu to implement the limit sanction relief requir by the Joint Plan of Action JPOA the interim agreement reach in Novemb 2013
p309
sI309
V One of the JPOA s relief measur ha been to releas million to Iran each month of the roughli billion of Iran s asset frozen in oversea account Those payment would stop
p310
sI310
V The most import of the JPOA s interim sanction relief measur involv the purchas of Iranian crude oil Start in 2012 U S oil sanction compel key countri purchas Iranian crude to make signific cut in their import everi six month Under the JPOA those countri were allow to freez reduct at alreadi reduc level without risk sanction The end of JPOA sanction relief under the INARA would mean that the administr would be requir to impos sanction on countri import Iranian crude oil if they did not make signific addit reduct over the next six month The countri that would be affect would includ China India Japan South Korea and Turkey
p311
sI311
V The key would be China the largest purchas of Iranian crude which reluctantli made major cut in import to provid leverag for diplomaci Convinc that the Unit State walk away from an effect solut to the nuclear problem Beij might simpli ignor the re imposit of U S oil sanction and refus to make further cut forc the Unit State to choos between not impos sanction and expos them as a paper tiger or impos them and risk a major confront with China And even if the U S chose the more confront cours China could possibl find workaround creat new bank and compani to bear the brunt of sanction for facilit oil purchas while insul major Chines entiti from the reach of U S sanction and proceed to increas purchas
p312
sI312
V A less like possibl is that the Chines wish to avoid a confront with the Unit State and abl to find altern supplier in today s well suppli oil market might decid to go along with the re impos sanction But instead of make the signific addit reduct requir by U S sanction law roughli 20 percent addit cut over six month it might proffer a token reduct e g a few percent count on the Unit State to regard that as suffici not to trigger sanction rather than precipit a confront
p313
sI313
V To avoid commerci disadvantag India Japan and South Korea have been will sinc 2012 to reduc crude oil purchas onli as long as China wa do so Follow the reject of the nuclear deal they could be expect to follow Beij s lead either make token reduct of their own or ignor the re imposit of sanction in the expect that Washington would not pick a major fight with a unit front of region power and trade partner
p314
sI314
V So in the worst case congression reject could thrust the Unit State into a damag standoff threaten and possibl impos sanction against the world s lead economi in the uncertain hope of forestal a rapid hemorrhag of oil sanction In the best case the Unit State could win grudg support for token addit reduct But the likelihood of persuad Iran s princip custom to accept dramat new cut in purchas on a scale that could pressur Iran to make major concess it ha been unwil to make under the devast sanction it ha face for year is extrem small especi when all those custom view the negoti deal as reason and would resent Washington s decis to walk away from it
p315
sI315
V Meanwhil the Unit State would be tri to maintain exist sanction in area other than crude oil It would be assist in thi effort by the cautiou approach mani entiti could be expect to take when consid whether to buck the current sanction regim Major intern bank might be especi guard fear a cutoff from the U S financi system if they ran afoul of U S sanction
p316
sI316
V But the temptat to enter or re enter the Iranian market may in mani case overrid that caution In anticip of a nuclear agreement and the remov of sanction busi all over the world support by their govern have been eager to establish or restor commerci relationship with Iran and work on new deal Sens major opportun they want to move quickli lest they wait too long and find themselv at a disadvantag rel to their competitor A U S reject of the nuclear deal and the indefinit continu of American sanction would give mani of them paus But we could expect other to begin test whether exist U S sanction would be vigor enforc
p317
sI317
V Until now the Unit State ha had the strong support of the European Union and European govern in enforc sanction But in the wake of U S reject of an agreement that European govern strongli support European author may be less resolut in crack down on sanction evad
p318
sI318
V In an effort to hold the line on exist sanction the Unit State would need to pursu a vigor worldwid campaign to penal sanction buster threaten and impos sanction even on close alli and trade partner And as the rank of sanction evad grew and as the defector came to believ there wa strength in number such a campaign could becom increasingli confront futil and self defeat especi if the sanction entiti had substanti econom link to the Unit State
p319
sI319
V Exist sanction would not collaps suddenli But over time perhap a period of sever month to a year they would certainli erod And if keep the current sanction regim intact would be veri difficult persuad the intern commun to ratchet up sanction dramat what critic of the JCPOA are count on to pressur Iran to accept a deal" would be nearli imposs especi in the absenc of a major new provoc by Iran such as a rapid increas in it enrich capac
p320
sI320
V How would the Iranian react to congression reject of the JCPOA and U S effort to strengthen sanctions? Some engag mind Iranian might recommend take the road" let the American shoot themselv in the foot maintain the interim accord s nuclear freez and enhanc monitor measur without initi the nuclear and monitor step requir by the final deal launch a worldwid campaign to blame the Unit State for the collaps of the diplomat effort and plan for increas nuclear capac at a time when Iran would escap ani critic for do so
p321
sI321
V Howev such an Iranian reaction is veri unlik With the Unit State resum sanction that had been suspend dure the negoti and the U S presid legal bar from implement the comprehens sanction relief that wa Iran s main reason for reach the nuclear deal there is littl chanc of Tehran opt for the high road Spur on by domest oppon of the nuclear deal the suprem leader could be expect to retali against congression action by forbid step to implement the JCPOA and author the resumpt of nuclear activ suspend under the JPOA
p322
sI322
V To win over intern opinion and encourag the eros of intern sanction Iran might initi see advantag in onli a gradual increas in nuclear activ test advanc centrifug but not increas the number of oper centrifug resum the construct of the origin design Arak reactor suspend the convers of enrich uranium hexafluoride to oxid discontinu the JPOA s enhanc monitor measur and so on
p323
sI323
V Howev as time pass and the Iranian saw the Unit State activ seek to retain and expand sanction nuclear self restraint would becom less and less polit tenabl and Iran s nuclear capabl would grow Even then the Iranian might well be reluct to boost their capabl at a rate that would caus alarm and provid a justif for new sanction or the consider of militari option
p324
sI324
V Congression reject of the JCPOA would mean the end of negoti for quit some time With the U S pursu stronger sanction and the Iranian increas their nuclear capabl and each side accus the other of bad faith the climat for resum diplomaci would deterior Movement toward a militari confront would not be inevit it would depend significantli on the pace and direct of Iran s nuclear program
p325
sI325
V It is not inconceiv that a new round of negoti could begin at some futur date But prospect for success would be more remot than at present Iranian oppon of negoti would have the conveni and domest power argument that Iranian concess make littl sens when the American have demonstr that they cannot be trust to live up to their end of ani deal And by the time new negoti got underway both the scale and technic sophist of Iran s nuclear program would be significantli greater than they are today
p326

V Go back to battleground issu list Conclusion: An imperfect but worthi deal
p328
sI328
V The preced discuss ha focus on battleground issu relat to the nuclear deal Of cours congression debat and vote will not be base exclus or even primarili on the merit and shortcom of the deal itself For mani member of Congress and the American public at larg the particular of the JCPOA may be less import than question surround the deal: Can we trust the Iranians? Will the deal moder Iranian region behavior or empow them to expand their destabil activities? Will it affect the intern polit balanc in Iran between pragmatist and ideologu strengthen or jeopard the secur of tradit U S friend in the region signal a declin in America s region role or lead to a reassert of U S leadership?
p329
sI329
V These are all crucial question that need to be thoroughli debat They should and will have an import bear on ani congression vote But the threshold test for the nuclear deal is whether it achiev it essenti goal of prevent Iran from acquir nuclear weapon And to evalu whether the JCPOA pass thi critic test the issu dealt with here must be well understood
p330
sI330
V Ani discuss of these battleground issu expos some of the deal s imperfect Thi is not surpris Element of the deal wide seen as posit do not becom battleground issu The negoti outcom that attract the most critic and attent are those where difficult compromis have been made As the deal s support would acknowledg it would have been better for restrict on enrich capac to last longer for Iran to disclos the detail and true purpos of it past activ for inspect to be carri out without advanc notif for constraint on convent arm and ballist missil to be accept as bind by Iran and to last indefinit and for restrict asset to be releas gradual over time Unfortun these and other ideal outcom were not achiev
p331
sI331
V Howev such ideal but unrealizable outcom are not necessari to achiev an accept agreement The question and concern rais by the battleground issu can be address by U S polici that supplement the deal and bolster it overal effect None of these polici are constrain by the JCPOA
p332
sI332
V To address concern about Iran reach threshold nuclear statu in the out year the Unit State should adopt a firm public polici aim at deter a futur Iranian decis to cross the threshold and build nuclear weapon With the endors of Congress U S presid should declar that the Unit State will use ani mean necessari includ militari forc to prevent Iran from acquir nuclear weapon In that connect the Unit State should identifi privat to Tehran activ that have no plausibl peac justif in Iran and would be regard as evid that Iran had decid to pursu nuclear weapon e g product of highli enrich uranium or separ plutonium

V Iran would object mightili to a bait and switch in which the Unit State relax nuclear relat sanction under the JCPOA but reimpos them separ as punish for other Iranian behavior Such a move would almost certainli drive Iran to pull out of the deal argu that Washington fail to hold up it end of the bargain Inde earlier thi week Iran s Suprem Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei declar that Iran would withdraw from the agreement if the West fail to lift sanction as promis It is safe to assum Tehran would do the same Treasuri Secretari Jack Lew warn lawmak if the Unit State were to reimpos the nuclear sanction with a new label

V Most discuss of how Congress could react to the JCPOA focu on how it could forc Iranian complianc by util neg incent such as addit sanction or the threat of forc Howev Congress could also encourag Iran to adher to the deal by hold out the prospect of futur reward The JCPOA doe not call for the lift of statutori sanction that prevent U S compani from do busi in or with Iran But Congress could hold hear to examin what level of Iranian complianc with the JCPOA might at some point justifi the lift of these prohibit Such hear could dangl the prospect of futur econom relat with the Unit State in front of the Iranian govern provid an allur reward for full implement of the JCPOA that would have the side benefit of creat job and gener profit in the Unit State as well
p368
sI368
V Congression oppon of the agreement with Iran have so far focus on how they could derail it That battl is over If their goal is Iranian complianc Congress should now allow the JCPOA to go forward monitor it implement care and then respond to Iranian behavior with further incent that reward Tehran for compli or penalti that punish it for fail to do so To continu work ceaselessli to undermin the deal at thi point work against that goal sinc it would undermin the credibl of the Unit State and becaus other countri will relax sanction regardless of what Washington doe give Iran the opportun to reap econom benefit while continu it nuclear program Legisl have a continu role to play but if Iran s complianc is Congress s goal the most effect move is to stop tri to kill the agreement and focu instead on ensur that it is effect implement

V 1 Doe the Presid Have a Statutori Duti to Transmit the IAEA Side Deals?
p372
sI372
V Section a of the Iran Review Act requir the Presid to to the appropri congression committe and leadership the agreement with Iran as defin in subsect h 1 includ all relat materi and annex Subsect h 1 in turn provides:
p373
sI373
V The term agreement mean an agreement relat to the nuclear program of Iran that includ the Unit State commit the Unit State to take action or pursuant to which the Unit State commit or otherwis agre to take action regardless of the form it take whether a polit commit or otherwis and regardless of whether it is legal bind or not includ ani joint comprehens plan of action enter into or made between Iran and ani other parti and ani addit materi relat thereto includ annex appendic codicil side agreement implement materi document and guidanc technic or other understand and ani relat agreement whether enter into or implement prior to the agreement or to be enter into or implement in the futur
p374
sI374
V Thi definit includ the Joint Comprehens Plan of Action JCPOA the main deal plu addit materi relat thereto includ side agreement At first glanc the definit appear to includ the side deal between the IAEA and Iran that concern verif of the JCPOA and militari dimens of Iran s nuclear weapon program These deal are side agreement to the JCPOA and they clearli relat to it Howev as Rob Howse note the definit is limit at the begin of Subsect h 1 to an agreement that the Unit State commit the Unit State to take action or pursuant to which the Unit State commit or otherwis agre to take action The IAEA side deal with Iran are not one that includ the Unit State or that commit it to take action Thu Howse conclud the Presid ha no duti to transmit them
p375
sI375
V That is a convinc point as far as it goe But there is a differ argument for requir the Presid to transmit the IAEA side deal that I have not yet seen made and that avoid the Howse rejoind That argument is that subsect h 1 includ the limit definit that Howse note appli to and defin onli the term in Section a The claus in Section a that is set off by comma suggest that the definit in h 1 interpret onli the term and that the phrase relat materi and annexes" form a separ part of the Presid s oblig under Section a that is not specif defin in subsect h 1 If the definit in h 1 were meant to appli to materi and annex it would read: agreement includ all relat materi and annex as defin in subsect h 1 I thu think it is at least plausibl to read Section a to mean that the Presid must disclos the agreement and relat materi that commit the Unit State plu all relat materi and annex beyond the one that commit the Unit State which might includ the IAEA side agreement Congress might well have want to defin the agreement that commit the Unit State veri broadli as the definit doe but also includ the undefin materi and annexes" beyond the one that commit the Unit State in the Presid s duti to transmit
p376
sI376
V Complic thi reason howev is the term in Section a Thi term most natur suggest that the materi and annexes" form a subset of the defin term which would exclud the side deal becaus they do not commit the Unit State Thi appear to be the sens in which is use in at least mani other part of the Review Act The main problem with thi read of in Section a howev is that it make the phrase materi and annexes" redund sinc the term is defin to includ relat materi and annex Interpret that render statutori word superflu are all thing equal disfavor By contrast to the inclus sens of one could read to be addit in the sens of make the relat materi and annex beyond the agreement and relat materi that concern the U S commit part of the Presid s oblig to transmit Thi read ha the virtu of avoid the redund and give independ mean to the word materi and annex But while it is an accept interpret of it is not the favor one I think
p377
sI377
V For all of these reason I think there is a plausibl but not obvious win argument that the plain term of the Review Act requir the Presid to transmit the IAEA side deal to Congress The Presid claim that he doe not possess the side deal to disclos That make it hard for him to compli with the statut and imposs to compli if he ha no chanc of obtain the side deal But such an imposs now should not by itself affect the best read of what Congress demand in May when it enact the Iran Review Act It might howev affect how court view the matter as I discuss below
p378
sI378
V 2 The Consequ of the Presid s Failur to Transmit the IAEA Side Deal
p379
sI379
V A decent but again not clinch case can be made that the consequ of failur to transmit the side IAEA deal is that the Presid cannot yet lift the Iran sanction
p380
sI380
V Section b 3 of the Act provides: Prior to and dure the period for transmiss of an agreement in subsect a 1 the Presid may not waiv suspend reduc provid relief from or otherwis limit the applic of statutori sanction with respect to Iran under ani provis of law or refrain from appli ani such sanction pursuant to an agreement describ in subsect a The argument against the Presid is that becaus he ha not yet transmit the entir agreement i e the IAEA side deal to Congress the review period ha not begun to run and the Presid thu not waiv etc the statutori sanction against Iran
p381
sI381
V The argument is not airtight It depend on whether we are still to and dure the period for transmiss of the agreement The plain text of the Review Act suggest that we are beyond that period becaus the Presid had a duti to under Section a to transmit the agreement and all relat materi and annex within five day after the agreement wa reach The time frame prior to and dure the period for transmiss began and end in Juli Thu the argument for the Presid goe the sixti day clock for Congress s review period began to run in Juli just as Congress appear to assum at the time and until veri recent The counterargu is that the Presid cannot be reliev of the statutori ban on lift sanction by defi the deadlin for submit the agreement No one would accept that the Presid could have avoid the statutori duti to maintain sanction by simpli not submit the JCPOA the same reason appli to the side agreement if they are materials" under Section a Thi argument howev lack an obviou textual basi and one might think that if Congress get the advantag of the plain text for the argument about the Presid s duti to transmit it must suffer the disadvantag of the plain text for the consequ of the Presid s failur to transmit Also cut against the argument that the review period ha not yet begun to run is the fact that until veri recent Congress act as if the period of review had begun to run
p382
sI382
V I am sure there are other argument for and against both the Presid s duti to transmit the IAEA side agreement and the Presid s author to waiv sanction if he fail to satisfi a statutori duti to transmit But let s assum that the argument against the Presid succe to the extent that a plausibl textual case ha been made that the Iran Review Act prohibit the Presid from waiv the sanction becaus he ha not yet submit materi relat to the agreement and thu the period of congression review ha not yet start to run What then?
p383
sI383
V There is talk of Congress su the Presid But in litig Congress face mani hurdl to success beyond what a nake read of the statut suggest
p384
sI384
V Stand Eugen Kontorovich cover thi issu last week I am more skeptic than he is about Congress s stand to sue the Presid over hi arguabl failur to follow the law I doubt that what happen here rise to the level of nullification" requir by Raines v Byrd though the case for stand would be strengthen if one or both of the chamber of Congress author the suit I disagre with Eugen that the recent decis in Hous of Repres v Burwell help here There the court recogn congression stand to redress a clear presidenti usurp of Congress s constituional power over the purs But it held that the Hous lack stand to argu as would be the case in Review Act litig that the Presid ha misinterpret or disregard the law in execut As the court said:
p385
sI385
V If such an argument were accept everi instanc of an extra statutori action by an Execut offic might constitut a cogniz constitut violat redressable by Congress through a lawsuit Such a conclus would contradict decad of administr law and preced in which court have guard against specter of gener legisl stand base upon claim that the Execut Branch is misinterpret a statut or the Constitut
p386
sI386
V While I don t think Congress will have stand I agre with Eugen that if a State is su over it continu sanction against Iran the merit of the Presid s waiver might be litig But mani power theori of preemption would be in play against the State argument
p387
sI387
V Articl II If the litig reach the merit the Presid will like make a number of constitut argument about Congress intrud on hi Articl II power One argument might be that the requir that he submit the side deal is unconstitut becaus the Presid cannot be forc to submit sensit inform that he believ would jeopard nation secur Last month the Justic Depart releas a 2003 OLC memo that made an argument of thi sort in the similar context of not provid Congress with inform relat to WMD The argument in the memo is a full throated defens of presidenti prerog that wa typic of the period but a form of the argument ha a pedigre that goe back through recent administr back to the Iran Contra imbroglio and back yet further as to Washington s refus to turn over inform about the Jay treati to the Hous of repres Marci Wheeler first note the connect between the OLC memo and the Iran matter
p388
sI388
V I expect that the administr would argu that the requir to turn over a secret side deal that it did not negoti or possess but that is crucial to the success of an import nuclear arm control agreement is unconstitut At a minimum and more like I think it would argu that the possibl of unconstitution is a reason not to read the ambigu statut to demand such inform Relatedly it might also argu reli on argument found in OLC opinion like thi one that the congression demand for inform relat to the agreement that the Presid doe not possess unconstitut compel the Presid to engag in diplomat activ to among other thing seek and obtain the agreement I expect it would also argu at least under constitut avoid that read the Review Act to requir transmiss of the IAEA side deal would in the word of Zivotofsky II constitut a command that would prevent the Nation from speak with one voic and also prevent the Execut itself from do so in conduct foreign relat
p389
sI389
V I lack time now assess these argument on the merit But I do think that argument of thi sort will have special salienc less perhap for their legal merit than as reason that judg might latch on to in order to avoid rule against the Presid in thi veri high stake diplomat context Cf Zivotofsky II Which lead to the final point
p390
sI390
V Defer De Jure and De Facto If the case reach the merit the Presid will argu for defer in the matter in interpret the statut and in assess the impact of a presidenti loss on foreign relat Much more import than the formal legal argument for defer is that it is highli unlik that a court especi an appel court and almost certainli the Suprem Court is go to find the statutori argument here compel enough to issu an injunct or some other form of relief that would prevent the Presid from waiv sanction and thu possibl blow up the Iran Deal The court are not on the basi of the statutori argument sketch abov go to unwind the Iran Deal that Congress could not unwind on it own especi sinc Congress act for so long as if the review period had been trigger Whether court get to that conclus through statutori interpret includ constitut avoid and execut defer or through stand or some other justiciability gambit they will get there Of that I am more confid than anyth I have said to thi point
p391
sI391
V PS: I cannot resist a friendli poke at Andi McCarthi who wa a critic of the Iran Review Act and befor that an oppon of congression restrict on presidenti waiver of sanction but who is now a champion of the argument that the Iran Review Act bar the Presid from waiv sanction Andi continu to claim that the JCPOA s oppon would have been better off without the Review Act But the clear fact is that without the Act Obama would have ignor Congress altogeth and alreadi exercis hi preexist statutori author to lift the Iran sanction As I have explain befor the idea that the Congress or Senat could have forc the Presid to submit the JCPOA for approv as a treati or congression execut agreement is a fantasi In ani event I am glad that Andi is now support at least in part of the Iran Review Act which I doubt will stop the Presid from lift sanction but which ha forc the Presid to disclos a lot which ha spark veri import public deliber and which ha result in member of Congress be on record and account for the subsequ success or failur of the JCPOA

V The promis of sanction relief help bring Iran to negoti over it nuclear program yield an accord due to be implement in the come month Some member of the U S Congress are now call for tighten sanction link to Iran s region and domest behavior but a number of expert say thi could drive Iran to abandon it nuclear commit As the White Hous and Congress consid next step is requir is prudenc say Richard Nephew director of the Econom Statecraft Sanction and Energi Market program at Columbia Univers s School of Intern and Public Affair Nephew a former sanction offici at the U S State Depart say it will be import to balanc the need of ensur a deal aim at curb Iran s nuclear program with concern about how to restrain Iran s action in the region

V Under the term of the Joint Comprehens Plan of Action JCPOA ink by Iran and major power Iran is expect to take step to restrict it nuclear program befor it receiv sanction relief What major sanction should we expect to see lift when the IAEA had verifi Iran s compliance?Debate in Washington ha turn to expand exist nonnuclear sanction and perhap impos new one relat to support for terror destabil the region missil prolifer and human right What might those sanction entail and how will they be perceiv by Tehran?It will basic be all those sanction that govern foreign trade with Iran Thi cover the oil and ga sector as well as financi transport and other associ servic Nineti five percent of Iran s extern econom activ will be cover by the sanction relief
p395

V There are import except Particular bank for instanc will still be on U S sanction list and some type of trade for instanc with item that could be use in nuclear program but may not necessarili be will also still be cover Of cours the U S primari embargo involv all of those differ thing will remain fulli in place

V These nonnuclear sanction have been enforc vigor throughout the interim Joint Plan of Action and the nonnuclear sanction architectur ha not onli been preserv under the negoti it s been enhanc The Treasuri Depart intellig commun and State Depart will keep look for evid of bad Iranian behavior base on what s present in law If you re support Hezbollah Hamas the Houthis in Yemen or Syrian Presid Bashar al Assad and you re an Iranian you are potenti subject to sanction If you are a facilit of Iranian support for those bad actor you are potenti subject to sanction That will continu across the front of human right terror ballist missil prolifer If you do busi with Iranian who have been found to support terror you re potenti subject to sanction
p398
sI398
V If you are a bank in Europ and you do busi transact on behalf of the Iran Revolutionari Guard Corp even if the EU delists the IRGC U S sanction will still mean that those bank that do that busi are potenti court penalti That includ be cut off from the U S financi system
p399
sI399
V There is some interest in look at where there will be potenti gap onc UN arm embargo restrict laps in five year as well as the ballist missil relat restrict in eight year There could be effort to impos sanction on ani transfer of convent arm to or from Iran that wouldn t otherwis be captur by the UN embargo
p400
sI400
V When the UN arm and ballist missil embargo laps could unilater U S measur be as effect as multilater measur they d be replacing?The Iranian have as much interest in the nuclear deal be sustain as the Unit State so I doubt that for one addit Iranian bank or one addit IRGC person be sanction they re go to walk away from the deal But if the Unit State tri to sanction the entireti of the Iranian financi system all over again use the excus of terror the Iranian will walk away
p401
sI401
V What is requir is prudenc to decid whether the penalti that would be impos on Iranian bad actor are signific enough that it could stop their bad activ or impair their bad activ and that it s worth risk a possibl neg Iranian respons If we see Iranian bad actor do thing in violat of U S law we ought to consid sanction them even more so if we think our sanction will have a posit impact But if we re just look for way to look tough that s a bad reason to take new measur
p402
sI402
V You ve rais the possibl that Iran s economi could remain stagnant for year to come whether a residu effect of sanction or becaus of unrel structur problem and Presid Hassan Rouhani s promis of an econom dividend from the nuclear accord will ring hollow Could that jeopard the agreement? We re all suppos to abid by the term of UN Secur Council resolut But let s be blunt: the UN arm embargo ha not stop the Iranian from export arm to Assad Hamas and the Taliban or from support the Houthis
p403
sI403
V Will the risk of sanction snap back or uncertainti about U S intent keep firm out of Iran?U S sanction have been help in ensur that if violat of the UN arm embargo are detect a penalti can be impos There s no veto that can block imposit of U S sanction with regard to arm transfer wherea in the UN system there is Unilater U S action can have more teeth than UN action even if it doesn t have the imprimatur of UN support The practic may alway trump the rhetor
p404
sI404
V Absolut There will be tremend polit pressur on Rouhani to make good on the expect that he s rais in hi campaign rhetor and what he s said while negoti the deal If the economi stall out even if the sanction relief from the deal is work just fine there will tremend pressur on the govern to explain itself
p405
sI405
V On the U S side do you forese ani legisl measur threaten implement of the agreement?The easiest explan that the Iranian govern could come up with is struck a great deal but sanction the West those aw Great Satan American have hinder our abil to advanc ourselv which wa suppos to be part of the JCPOA You could see competitor to Rouhani in the 2017 elect or beyond that say shouldn t reelect Rouhani becaus he hasn t deliv the good wherea I can and I ll start by reject the nuclear deal
p406
sI406
V The near term risk of thi kind of develop is pretti low becaus everyon understand it ll take some time for the economi to rebound But four or five year down the line that argument won t work anymor
p407

p408
sI408
V The Unit State and European Union maintain separ sanction list Doe that undermin their efficacy?The other factor is the U S polit system If we decid we re not go to fulfil our part of the deal then the deal will fall apart and a lot of European and Asian compani will be at risk When you have a U S presidenti debat in which mani of the Republican candid say they re go to rip up the deal a thought European compani is not go to make a major invest in Tehran until after we know who s go to be presid and what their approach to Iran is realli go to be
p409
sI409
V Some peopl in Washington are talk about tri to reimpos the oil embargo that is set to be lift under the JCPOA as a part of strangl the Iranian economi Noth will help the Iranian walk away from a deal faster than that If the idea is to stop terror peopl should look at recent history: The Iranian have been under tremend econom pressur in larg part becaus of oil sanction and they haven t stop their support for terror
p410
sI410
V What sanction lesson should policymak take from the experi of negoti the nuclear accord?Secondly a lot of sanction advoc say that we ought to make sure that there is a good conduct test to let Iranian bank off design list Iranian bank are not go to be abl to pass that test they re not go to provid assur that they won t provid fund for IRGC relat compani sinc they re a major part of the Iranian economi The Iranian economi couldn t support that and the Iranian govern will walk away
p411
sI411
V The third major categori is the piecem approach thi new idea in Washington of tri to ratchet over time sanction associ with terror and whatnot to reengineer what we alreadi had for nuclear nonprolifer A lot of thi is focus on tri to sanction everi compani that s gotten near the IRGC Again that s profoundli danger in term of what the Iranian would do
p412
sI412
V Thi interview ha been condens and edit Not yet our sanction list are quit in sync Over time some peopl and entiti will come off notabl the IRGC as well as other that the European sanction for nuclear reason even if we have them sanction for terror reason That will be a problem legal as well as polit come eight to ten year from now when the sanction are suppos to come off in Europ
p413
sI413
V The bigger problem is if we continu to have differ of view with Europ about what is terror and support for terror For exampl we have been design and sanction Hezbollah for a long time The European Union onli impos sanction on Hezbollah in 2013 and even then onli on it militari wing
p414
sI414

p415
sI415
V That doesn t mean we shouldn t have tough sanction on those we ve defin as bad guy but we ought to make sure that peopl understand we re not do it caprici That s one risk I see in thi Iran debate: A lot of peopl in the world think that we re sanction happi and becaus we are not go to deal with the consequ of it becaus U S firm face a gener trade embargo with Iran and their compani are that there s no reason whi we shouldn t be Over time that mindset will lead peopl to say are we go to reli on the U S financi system?"

V When Aaron Stein wa studi nuclear nonprolifer at Middlebury Colleg s Monterey graduat program the student would sometim construct what they thought would be the best possibl nuclear inspect and monitor regim
p417

V Year later Stein is now a Middl East and nuclear prolifer expert with the Royal Unit Servic Institut as well as the Geneva Centre for Secur Polici and the Atlant Council And in April he told me that the Iran nuclear deal the broad stroke of which had just been announc look an aw lot like those ideal hypotheticals he d put togeth in grad school
p418
sI418
V I wa do my nonprolifer train at Monterey thi is the type of inspect regim that we would dream up in our head he said at the time would hope that thi would be the way to actual verifi all enrich program but thought that would never be feasibl
p419
sI419
V Stein conclud it would make excel deal" if the negoti could turn those broad stroke into a formal final agreement Thi week they did exactli that
p420
sI420
V The full final Iran nuclear deal in all area Stein said on Tuesday make the possibl of Iran develop a nuclear weapon in the next 25 year extrem remot
p421
sI421
V Like mani observ I doubt in recent month that Iran and world power would ever reach thi stage the setback and delay had simpli been too mani Now here we are and the term are astoundingli favor to the Unit State Arm control and nuclear nonprolifer expert are herald it as a huge success
p422
sI422
V The deal requir Iran to surrend some crucial compon of it nuclear program in part or even in whole Here are the highlights:
p423
sI423
V Iran will give up about 14 000 of it 20 000 centrifug
p424
sI424
V Iran will give up all but it most rudimentari outdat centrifuges: It first gener IR 1s knockoff of 1970s European model are all it get to keep It will not be allow to build or develop newer model
p425
sI425
V Iran will give up 97 percent of it enrich uranium it will hold on to onli 300 kilogram of it 10 000 kilogram stockpil in it current form
p426
sI426
V Iran will destroy or export the core of it plutonium plant at Arak and replac it with a new core that cannot produc weapon grade plutonium It will ship out all spent nuclear fuel
p427
sI427
V Iran would simpli not have much of it nuclear program left after all thi
p428
sI428
V A shorthand peopl sometim use to evalu the size of Iran s nuclear program is it time If Suprem Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei woke up tomorrow morn and decid to set hi entir nuclear program toward build a nuclear warhead to out" to a bomb as of today it would take him two or three month Under the term of the deal hi program would be so much smaller that it would take him an entir year to build a singl nuclear warhead
p429
sI429
V wa shock to read that they got them to agre to let us walk around their centrifug product facil That s amaz These term are not abject surrend Iran is allow to keep a small nuclear program and it won some concess of it own For exampl what littl uranium enrich is allow will be done at Iran s facil at Natanz a harden reinforc concret structur that wa onc use for covert enrich and that the US had hope to close
p430
sI430
V Iran will also be allow to do some research at Fordow anoth harden facil the US had want to close though the research is restrict and will be bar from use fissil materi These are not big concess and they matter mostli for their symbol valu but it s someth
p431
sI431
V Still when you look at mani of the specif laid out in the deal the hard number and timet and the detail proscript those all tend to be quit favor to the Unit State
p432
sI432
V The result is pretti clear Stein said: intent of thi agreement is to take the weapon option off the tabl for the next 25 year and the agreement doe that
p433
sI433
V The deal is strong on mani term but it strongest on what wa alway go to be among the most crucial: inspect
p434
sI434
V Whatev number of centrifug Iran ha or doesn t have whatev amount of uranium it s allow to keep or forc to give up none of it matter unless inspector have enough author to hold Tehran to it end of the deal and to convinc the Iranian that they could never get away with cheat To say the US got favor term here would be quit an understat the Iranian when it come to inspect practic gave away the farm
p435
sI435
V would give it an A Stein said in April of the framework When I ask why: of the inspect and transpar
p436
sI436
V There are two reason inspect are so import The first is that super stringent inspect are a deterrent: If the Iranian know that ani deviat is go to be quickli caught they have much less incent to tri to cheat and much more incent to uphold their side of the deal
p437
sI437
V would give it an A" The second is that if Iran were to tri a build a nuclear weapon now it like wouldn t use the materi that s alreadi known to the world and be monitor Rather the Iranian would secretli manufactur some off the book centrifug secretli mine some off the book uranium and squirrel it all away to a new secret underground facil somewher That would be the onli way for Iran to build up enough of an arsen such that by the time the world found out it would be too late to do anyth about it
p438
sI438
V Realli robust inspect would be the best way stop that from happen They would prevent Iran from sneak off centrifug or siphon away uranium that could be use to build an off the grid nuclear weapon program without the world find out
p439
sI439
V Under thi deal the inspect are so strong Stein said that if Iran tri to cheat on the deal likelihood of get caught is near 100 percent
p440
sI440
V The inspect issu ha not gotten much polit attent When I spoke to Jeffrey Lewi the director of the East Asia Nonprolifer Program at Middlebury s Monterey Institut of Intern Studi back in March befor the framework wa announc he seem worri that negoti would not focu on it much Rather overwhelm polit focu in Washington and Tehran on issu like Iran s number of allow centrifug seem like to push inspect from the top prioriti
p441
sI441
V Lewi suggest that a top item on hi wish list would be inspect so robust that inspector don t just get to visit enrich site like Natanz and Fordow but also centrifug factori That he said be a big achiev
p442
sI442
V Sure enough Lewi got hi wish and then some: centrifug factori inspect is one of the term in the framework and it s pretti robust For the next 20 year inspector would have continu surveil at Iran s centrifug rotor and bellow product and storag facil
p443
sI443
V That s part of whi when I ask Lewi to grade the final deal thi week he gave me the same answer that Stein had: would give it an A
p444
sI444
V wa shock to read that they got them to agre to let us walk around their centrifug product facil That s amaz Stein said in April when the first term came out That provis is now part of the final deal
p445
sI445
V It s not just centrifug factori Inspector will have access to all part of Iran s nuclear suppli chain includ it uranium mine and the mill where it process uranium ore Inspector will also not just monitor but be requir to pre approv all sale to Iran of nuclear relat equip Thi provis also appli to someth call use" materi which mean ani equip that could be use toward a nuclear program
p446
sI446
V The inspect and transpar on the rotor and the bellow and the uranium mine is more than I ever thought would be in thi agreement Stein ad
p447
sI447
V How the deal prevent Iran from go nuclear for the next 25 year
p448
sI448
V When I talk to Stein thi week we discuss the scenario that thi deal is all about: What happen if Iran decid it want to build a nuclear bomb? I ask him to walk me through how that would happen and how effect thi deal would be at stop it
p449
sI449
V would do Fordow 2 0 he said refer to the underground Fordow facil where Iran had previous conduct secret and illeg nuclear develop In other word they would build anoth underground bunker and do it there Iran is a big countri and even veri strong inspect can t spot everi hole in the ground But they would need two thing for thi and both in larg supply: uranium ore and centrifug Thi is where the deal come in
p450
sI450
V First Stein explain would siphon off uranium from an undeclar mine But under the deal s not realli possibl
p451
sI451
V onli ha two mine he said both of which will be under heavi inspect and monitor doe not have rich uranium deposit despit it claim to the contrari We should know we help develop those field in the 1970s
p452
sI452
V all of a sudden a barrel of uranium at a convers facil doesn t show up we d know he explain inspector have an account of what come out of the ground they have an account of what ha been refin at the process plant They have an account of what s been convert then they have an account of what show up at Natanz and then they have an account of what come out the back end
p453
sI453
V But for the sake of see through the hypothet let s say that somehow magic Iran is abl to sneak away the larg amount of uranium ore necessari for a bomb Then what?
p454
sI454
V they would build centrifug without us know becaus a centrifug facil is tini Stein said don t realli pick them up we ve never realli been abl to find them when they are up
p455
sI455
V The deal address thi as well: Not onli will inspector keep tab on everi singl centrifug in the countri but they will have eye on the centrifug factori on machin that could be use to make a centrifug even on import of technolog that could be use to build a machin that could be use to build a centrifug
p456
sI456
V snapback thing is realli clever" the agreement they have to account for all of their flow form machin that can be use to build a centrifug give us a list of where they are and then put them under monitor Stein said counter to that is they just won t tell us they won t declar everyth That s to be expect so don t trust that That s where the deal s monitor of thing like use" technolog that can have non nuclear as well as nuclear use come into play
p457
sI457
V Meanwhil Iran will have a rel small program of approv centrifug and energi grade uranium But all of thi will be under constant monitor make it essenti imposs for Iran to use them for anyth nefari without the world know pretti quickli
p458
sI458
V But let s keep the hypothet go Let s say that Iran break the restrict on centrifug or uranium and that the inspector or US intellig inevit find out What happen then?
p459
sI459
V What happen is that intern sanction the sanction that so hurt Iran s economi that it came limp up to the negoti tabl come back Thi wa alway go to be a veri difficult part of the deal the sanction are so power becaus they come from the European Union and from the Unit Nation back even by China and Russia all of whom are more skittish than the US about punish Iran So how do you make sure they ll go along with reimpos sanctions? How do you make that threat so sever and so certain that Iran won t dare test it?
p460
sI460
V The solut they came up with is an elabor mechan they re call
p461
sI461
V snapback thing is realli clever I had to read it a coupl of time to make sure it said what I think it said Jeffrey Lewi the Middlebury nuclear expert told me
p462
sI462
V If the US think Iran is cheat the first step is take it to a special commiss of the seven countri that sign the deal plu the European Union wait you re say t Russia or China just use thi process to stall or outright block the US?" Nope they can t becaus if the US is still unhappi after a few week it can kick the issu up to the UN Secur Council
p463
sI463
V wait you say again t Russia and China just veto anyth the US bring up there?" Nope they can t meddl there either If the US complain to the Secur Council and after 30 day the Secur Council doe noth and the US can ensur it doe noth by veto ani resolut then under the deal the sanction will automat come back into forc
p464
sI464
V sound like the US can blow up the deal ani time it want and revert to sanction Lewi said And there s a good reason for that: s just how thing are anyway
p465
sI465
V But say all of that happen say that Iran cheat on the deal we inevit catch them all the sanction come back and somehow Iran keep chug away anyway on illeg nuclear develop Thi seem unlik if thi is Iran s plan they just sign a deal make it far more difficult to do it but it s worth imagin What then?
p466
sI466
V militari forc issu would come back Stein said In other word it would take us back where we were a few year ago with the US threaten militari action against Iran It is worth again recal that that end with Iran agre to nuclear negoti in which it willingli gave up the bulk of it nuclear program so it seem to want to avoid thi scenario
p467
sI467
V But if thi worst case scenario should happen then the deal is still a net posit for the US think the US hand is actual strengthen in thi to be honest with you Stein said full account of where everyth is glean from invas inspect and monitor is a wonder target mechan for the Pentagon
p468
sI468
V The term in the agreement are just about the best that we could hope for even better in some way than mani had thought possibl The concess from Iran are pain and mani the concess by the US minor and few the detail surprisingli robust
p469
sI469
V a framework it s veri good Mark Fitzpatrick the director of the Non Prolifer and Disarma Program at the Intern Institut for Strateg Studi tweet in April when the broad term were reveal He ad sharp critic of Iran and skeptic of the talk told me after the announc that it seem to be heavili tilt in favour of the West
p470
sI470
V The Arm Control Associ issu a statement say that the agreement to lead to one of the most consequenti and far reach nuclear nonprolifer achiev in recent decad
p471
sI471
V Daryl Kimball the Arm Control Associ s chief told the Guardian deal is a major nuclear nonprolifer breakthrough that promis to prevent the emerg of anoth nuclear arm state and head off a nuclear arm race in the world s most volatil region
p472
sI472
V Andrea Berger of the Royal Unit Servic Institut call it incred achiev that much of the nuclear commun will enthusiast support And on and on
p473
sI473
V The way that all of thi work is quit technic But onc you understand thing like enrich and inspect regim and sanction snapback you see that the deal is actual pretti simpl Lewi put it well when we spoke:
p474
sI474
V I see it as a realli straightforward measur to slow down an enrich program that wa go gangbust
p475
sI475
V So you ask it slow it down?" Ye it slow it down in a way that is verifiable?" Ye it slow it down more than bomb it would?" Ye good deal
p476
sI476
V Watch: Presid Obama s remark on nuclear deal with Iran
p477
sI477
V The basic disput is this: Iran want to keep at least some of it nuclear program which it s had for year and insist is just for peac purpos The outsid world believ with good reason that Iran s program is at least partli design to illeg develop a nuclear bomb and want the program to stop
p478
sI478
V Thi ha been bad for everybodi Iran s economi is crippl by sanction The world wa face a possibl Iranian nuclear bomb which would be veri danger and worsen the alreadi violent Middl East It look increasingli like thi would end with the US have to choos between let Iran develop a nuclear bomb or go to war
p479
sI479
V Thi week s nuclear agreement is meant to resolv that year long fight to keep Iran from get a nuclear bomb but let it keep a veri small nuclear program and to do it peac
p480
sI480
V Thi process start almost immedi after Iranian elect a moder presid Hassan Rouhani in mid 2013 Iran came togeth in formal negoti with a group of world power known as the P5+1: Germani plu the five perman member of the UN Secur Council which are the US UK Russia China and Franc In April they announc a deal of the broad stroke It look veri favor to the US and got rave review from arm control expert Thi week they releas a final agreement that fill in the detail
p481
sI481
V The deal doe this: Iran will give up the bulk of it nuclear program name it enrich uranium nuclear fuel and it centrifug which turn fuel into weapon materi That will leav it with a program way too small to build a bomb
p482
sI482
V Iran will also submit to extrem invas inspect That s to make sure it isn t cheat for exampl by sneak nuclear materi off to some secret facil and develop a bomb there The idea is that Iran know it can t get away with cheat and will be punish if it doe so it won t tri
p483
sI483
V In exchang the world will remov a lot of the econom sanction it s place on Iran and Iran get to keep just enough of a nuclear program that it can save face
p484
sI484
V The provis gener last at least 10 year with some of them last 25 year so thi could be around for a long time
p485
sI485
V If the deal work it will prevent Iran from get a nuclear bomb it will eas Iran s econom suffer and it will make war less like huge improv Arm control expert tend to say thi is about the best we could get
p486
sI486
V If the deal fail then we will back where we are now except that it will be much harder to reimpos those tough econom sanction That s a possibl and deal critic have reason to worri But thi is almost certainli the world s best chanc for avert both war and a nuclear Iran and will like be rememb as a huge legaci achiev for Presid Obama
p487
sI487
V The final deal with Iran announc by the Unit State and other major world power doe what no amount of polit postur and vagu threat of militari action had manag to do befor It put strong verifi limit on Iran s abil to develop a nuclear weapon for at least the next 10 to 15 year and is potenti one of the most consequenti accord in recent diplomat histori with the abil not just to keep Iran from obtain a nuclear weapon but also to reshap Middl East polit
p488
sI488
V The deal the product of 20 arduou month of negoti would obvious have provid more caus for celebr if Iran had agre to complet dismantl all of it nuclear facil But the chanc of that happen were effect zero and even if all of Iran s nuclear relat build and instal were destroy no one can eras the knowledg Iranian scientist have acquir after work on nuclear project for decad
p489
sI489
V As describ by Mr Obama and other offici the deal seem sound and clearli in the interest of the Unit State the other nation that draft it and the state of Israel In return for a phase lift of intern econom sanction Iran will reduc by 98 percent it stockpil of low enrich uranium which can be process further into bomb grade fuel and reduc the number of oper centrifug use to enrich that fuel by two third to 5 060 These limit mean that if Iran ever decid to violat the agreement and make a dash for a nuclear bomb it will take a year to produc the weapon grade fuel need for a singl bomb compar with a coupl of month now
p490
sI490
V Mani of the variou restrict in the agreement will be in forc for 10 to 25 year Some notabl Iran s agreement to constant and technolog advanc monitor by the Intern Atom Energi Agenc will last indefinit as will it commit under the Nuclear Nonprolifer Treati to never produc a nuclear weapon Inspector will have access to suspici site necessari when necessari Presid Obama said and if Iran cheat that will be detect earli enough to respond includ by quickli reimpos sanction or take militari action
p491
sI491
V The deal nearli falter on a demand by Iran and Russia that Unit Nation ban on the purchas and sale of convent weapon and ballist missil be lift immedi But in the end the accord requir that the convent weapon ban remain in place for five year and the missil ban for eight year assum Iran abid by it commit
p492
sI492
V It is deepli unsettl that Prime Minist Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel deris dismiss the deal immedi as a mistak He Republican in Congress and most candid for the Republican presidenti nomin have oppos negoti with Iran from the outset yet offer no credibl altern to a negoti settlement The Republican presidenti hope repeat that formula today condemn of the deal with no credibl altern to offer
p493
sI493
V That said no one should have ani illus about Iran which consid Israel a sworn enemi often condemn the Unit State support Hezbollah and other terrorist organ and aspir to greater influenc in the region Onc sanction are lift it stand to gain access to billion of dollar from account in intern bank that have been frozen and from new oil export and other busi deal
p494
sI494
V American offici say that Iran will get that money over time and that it immedi prioriti will be to deal with press domest need More import mani American sanction will remain in place even after the deal is implement includ those relat to Iran s support for terror and it human right violat The Unit State ha to be extrem vigil in monitor how Iran use those new fund and in enforc those sanction
p495
sI495
V Agre on the nuclear deal is just the first step Congress get to review and vote on it Power forc like Mr Netanyahu have vow to defeat it and Mr Obama may have to make good on hi vow to veto ani resolut of disapprov It would be irrespons to squander thi chanc to rein in Iran s nuclear program
p496
sI496
V WASHINGTON As Presid Obama begin hi three week push to win approv of the Iran nuclear deal he is confront thi polit reality: Hi strongest argument in favor of passag ha also becom hi greatest vulner
p497
sI497
V Mr Obama ha been press the case that the sharp limit on how much nuclear fuel Iran can hold how mani centrifug it can spin and what kind of technolog it can acquir would make it extraordinarili difficult for Iran to race for the bomb over the next 15 year
p498
sI498
V Hi problem is that most of the signific constraint on Tehran s program laps after 15 year and after that Iran is free to produc uranium on an industri scale
p499
sI499
V chief reserv I have about the agreement is the fact that in 15 year they have a highli modern and intern legitim enrich capabl said Repres Adam B Schiff a California Democrat who support the accord that is a bitter pill to swallow
p500
sI500
V Even some of the most enthusiast backer of the agreement reach by six world power with Iran say they fear Mr Obama ha oversold some of the accord s virtu as he assert that it would all pathway to a nuclear weapon
p501
sI501
V A more accur descript is that the agreement is like to delay Iran s program for a decad and a half just as sanction and sabotag have slow Iran in recent year The administr s case essenti is that the benefit over the next 15 year overwhelmingli justifi the longer term risk of what come after
p502
sI502
V cours there are risk and they have to be acknowledg said R Nichola Burn who wa undersecretari of state in the Georg W Bush administr and ha testifi befor Congress in favor of the deal Mr Obama s convinc argument he ad that there is no better altern out there
p503
sI503
V In make the administr s case Mr Obama can underscor that econom sanction on Iran begin to lift onli as it reduc it current stockpil of low enrich uranium to 300 kilogram or 660 pound That is not enough to make a singl nuclear weapon and is a 98 percent reduct in it current stockpil of nearli 12 ton
p504
sI504
V The accord also call for regular inspect at Iran s nuclear instal and includ arrang to reimpos intern sanction if the Iranian are caught cheat
p505
sI505
V But the flip side is that after 15 year Iran would be allow to produc reactor grade fuel on an industri scale use far more advanc centrifug That may mean that the warn time if Iran decid to race for a bomb would shrink to week accord to a recent Brookings Institut analysi by Robert J Einhorn a former member of the American negoti team
p506
sI506
V Critic say that by that time Iran s economi would be stronger as would it abil to withstand econom sanction and it nuclear instal probabl would be better protect by air defens system which Iran is expect to buy from Russia
p507
sI507
V Some member of Congress and other expert are urg the administr to take fresh step to deter Iran from edg danger close to a nuclear weapon capabl after the main limit in the agreement expir
p508
sI508
V believ it buy 15 year for real said Denni B Ross who serv as a White Hous advis on Iran dure Mr Obama s first term and ha yet to decid if he will back the accord I do see vulner that I feel must be address The gap between threshold and weapon statu after year 15 is small
p509
sI509
V A Loss of Leverag The durat of the agreement is the most import and complex issu Under restrict impos by the accord Iran would need a full year to produc enough nuclear materi for a bomb current that timeline is two or three month accord to American intellig agenc But start at year 10 that time" would begin to shrink again as Iran get more centrifug into oper
p510
sI510
V Administr offici argu that it would be obviou if Iran made weapon grade fuel and negoti secur a perman ban on the metallurgi need to turn the fuel into a bomb
p511
sI511
V Support of the agreement are bet that improv intellig would deter Iran from race for a bomb Under the agreement inspector will be abl to monitor the product of rotor and other centrifug compon for up to 20 year and can monitor Iran s stock of uranium ore concentr for 25 year
p512
sI512
V Skeptic counter that after 15 year the Unit State would lose much of it leverag to stop a program So Mr Obama is tri to assur Congress that he and hi successor will creat that leverag
p513
sI513
V In a letter last week to Repres Jerrold Nadler a Democrat from New York Mr Obama detail the expand militari support he ha offer Israel and reaffirm that the Unit State retain the option to use econom sanction and even militari forc should Iran break out of it agreement
p514
sI514
V But Mr Obama s letter wa mostli a repackag of previou assur made to lawmak to Israel and to diplomat from Arab nation by the Persian Gulf
p515
sI515
V Some backer of the agreement are urg the White Hous and Congress to do more Mr Schiff and Mr Ross suggest in interview that the Unit State should put Iran on notic that it product of highli enrich uranium after the main provis of the accord expir would be taken by American offici as an indic that Iran ha decid to pursu nuclear weapon and could trigger an American militari strike
p516
sI516
V And both said the Unit State should also be prepar to provid bunker bust bomb to Israel to deter Iran from tri to shield illicit nuclear work underground Other have call for a long term congression to use militari force" if Iran violat the accord
p517
sI517
V Mr Ross ha also urg the White Hous to specifi the penalti for smaller violat of the accord an idea Mr Obama reject in hi letter say he want to maintain to decid what respons might be need
p518
sI518
V Energi Secretari Ernest J Moniz told a Hous committe last month that ani attempt by Iran to produc highli enrich uranium ani time must earn a sharp respons by all necessari mean
p519
sI519
V But some expert like Mr Einhorn say that thi warn should be convey directli if privat to Iran and that the Unit State should also increas intellig share with the world s nuclear inspector the Intern Atom Energi Agenc about possibl Iranian cheat
p520
sI520
V way to address challeng not cover by the agreement is to supplement it not renegoti it Mr Einhorn said
p521
sI521
V Account for the Past One of the trickier issu for Mr Obama and for Congress is how to assess whether Iran ha truli come clean about it past nuclear activ an enorm sensit issu for the Iranian And in the end it is one that Secretari of State John Kerri decid not to press too hard dure negoti for fear it would undermin the chanc of get stronger inspect for current and futur activ
p522
sI522
V The job of assess past activ is up to the I A E A It must certifi on Oct 15 that Iran is compli with a map" for cooper and report in Decemb on the agenc s conclus especi about Iran s alleg work develop nuclear trigger and design warhead
p523
sI523
V Critic of the accord note that Mr Kerri and hi chief negoti Wendi R Sherman said repeatedli that Iran must provid access to place and documents" that would resolv those question someth Iran ha refus to do for year But the I A E A ha never publicli specifi what it is ask or whom it must meet
p524
sI524
V Mr Einhorn in hi analysi conclud that full and honest disclosur by Iran of it past weaponization activ which would contradict Tehran s narr of an exclus peac program as well the suprem leader s fatwa that Islam forbid nuclear weapon wa never in the card
p525
sI525
V That said he conclud that may not be a obstacle" to conclud Iran s work ha halt
p526
sI526
V Access Nuclear Site While the accord call for regular inspect at Iran s nuclear site the enforc is of limit durat For exampl while the I A E A can request access to all declar nuclear site under the agreement it ha with all member state the far more intrus monitor at Iran s main nuclear enrich site at Natanz is not mandat after 15 year At that point Iran also would be free to carri out nuclear enrich at other locat
p527
sI527
V But the issu that ha garner the most attent is a day" rule for resolv disput if Iran refus to give inspector access to a suspici site anoth measur that expir after 15 year After that inspector can still demand to enter site but under the exist rule which do not set a deadlin for complianc Critic say that is far differ from anytime" access a phrase Mr Moniz and other in the administr use a few month ago and have come to regret
p528
sI528
V If Iran balk at an inspect then a commiss which includ Iran can decid on punit step includ a reimposition of econom sanction A major vote of the commiss suffic so even if Iran China and Russia object the sanction could go into effect
p529
sI529
V That is the theori In practic reimpos sanction could be polit challeng Iran ha warn that if sanction are reimpos it will no longer be bound by the accord The I A E A perhap fear it inspector would be kick out might hesit to start the 24 day clock
p530
sI530
V Mr Moniz argu that the 24 day time frame is suffici becaus Iran will not be abl to cover up evid of nuclear work dure that period sinc trace of nuclear materi could be expect well after three week But some expert say that Iran could cover up smaller scale illicit activ includ work on the special high explos that might serv as a trigger in a nuclear bomb
