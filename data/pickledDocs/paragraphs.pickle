V The same is true for the Iran deal announc Tuesday between Iran and six world power As Congress begin debat the agreement it oppon have three real altern The first is to kill the deal and the interim agreement that preced it and do noth els which mean few restraint on Iran s nuclear program The second is war But top American and Isra offici have warn that militari action against Iranian nuclear facil could ignit a catastroph region conflict and would be ineffect if not counterproduct in delay Iran s path to the bomb Meir Dagan who oversaw the Iran file as head of Israel s extern spi agenc the Mossad from 2002 to 2011 ha said an attack mean region war and in that case you would have given Iran the best possibl reason to continu the nuclear program Michael Hayden who ran the CIA under Georg W Bush from 2006 to 2009 ha warn that an attack would that which we are tri to prevent: an Iran that will spare noth to build a nuclear weapon

V Look It s My Name on Thi Obama Defend the Iran Nuclear DealImplicitly acknowledg thi most critic of the Iran deal propos a third alternative: increas sanction in hope of forc Iran to make further concess But in the short term the third altern look a lot like the first Whatev it defici the Iran deal place limit on Iran s nuclear program and enhanc oversight of it Walk away from the agreement in hope of get tougher restrict and you re guarante at least for the time be that there are bare ani restrict on the program at all

V What s more even if Congress pass new sanction it s quit like that the overal econom pressur on Iran will go down not up Most major European and Asian countri have closer econom tie to Iran than doe the Unit State and thu more domest pressur to resum them These countri have abided by intern sanction against Iran to vari degre becaus the Obama administr convinc their leader that sanction were a necessari prelud to a diplomat deal If U S offici reject a deal Iran s histor trade partner will not econom injur themselv indefinit Sanction declar Britain s ambassador to the Unit State in May have alreadi reach high water mark note that would probabl see more sanction erosion" if nuclear talk fail Germani s ambassador ad that diplomaci fail then the sanction regim might unravel

V The nuclear agreement nearli 100 page is long on technic detail that will be pars by highli experienc non prolifer expert But it ha sever compon that diminish and limit Iran s nuclear capabl Accord to the agreement Iran ha decid to drastic cut back on it number of centrifug The Fordow facil built under a mountain and impervi to most militari option will be turn into a research and scienc facil a smart compromis between Iran and the P5+1 The Arak heavi water reactor will be modifi so it cannot be use for product of nuclear weapon And Iran agre to keep it stockpil of enrich uranium to a minimum The Iranian nuclear program will also come under the close scrutini of the Intern Atom Energi Agenc IAEA Critic have claim that Iran should be subject to anywhere" inspect but it is complet unrealist to expect ani sovereign countri undef in war to accept such measur Iran may object to IAEA request for inspect but a major of the P5+1 can overrul it object Thi is a formula that give a clear advantag to the Unit State

V The nuclear deal will not transform Iran Suprem Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and the Revolutionari Guard will maintain control and attempt to prevent ani meaning chang Rouhani while pragmat enough to sign a nuclear deal is also cautiou enough not to make ani sudden move that could jolt the polit system and undermin hi own polit author But million of Iranian that seek chang will be given more space to breath The 2009 mass Green Movement demonstr a thirst for chang in Iran Iranian have been wait for a deal for year but they more than anyon are realist enough to realiz it limit
p12
sI12
V The deal is not perfect The strongest limit on Iran s nuclear program will last 10 to 15 year Iran will be more free to expand it nuclear program after that period but it will still remain under intern inspect And a deal will not chang the Iranian regim or it support for anti American forc in the Middl East Howev the nuclear deal is a first step for chang in Iran Chang may be slow to come as Iranian have long expect After all the 1979 revolut seemingli sudden and full of promis transform Iran forev and for the wors as mani Iranian are concern So slow chang may be the best option for them Washington for now ha come to the same conclus Posit chang in Iran cannot be achiev through war sanction and unend pressur It will take increment step The nuclear deal while not perfect is a step in the right direct

V How to make sens of the nuclear deal with Iran? Is it a necessari compromis that s prefer to the altern and potenti benefici for the Middl East? A feebl and indefens sop to Iranian leader bent on further destabil the region? A practic satisfi but moral troubl gambl born of bad options? The Atlant s Peter Beinart David Frum and Jeffrey Goldberg debat the new agreement and the swift and fierc reaction to it

V Oppon keep say that thi deal isn t as good as the Obama administr promis it would be and that it violat previou U S red line That s true It allow Iran to keep some enrich uranium It also doesn t includ anytim anywher right away inspect which I think the Obama administr wa foolish to promis a kind of parallel to when they said no one would lose coverag as a result of Obamacare
p18
sI18
V Wa the Iran Deal Worth It?Proponents like myself compar it to the alternatives: which are do noth war or tri to increas sanction in hope of get a better deal down the line What frustrat me is how rare I see oppon explain in ani detail how ani of these altern would be prefer A few year ago one saw more hawk argu for a militari strike I detail some of the folk who did last year But one rare hear anyon these day argu that a militari strike make sens Some say that a threat of force" would make Iran conced more But Israel and America have been threaten forc for a decad now Whi would more saber rattl work now? Besid to have your threat of forc be credibl don t you have to be will to follow through which requir explain whi militari action would be effect in retard the nuclear program and wouldn t make the current region conflict far worse? More often deal oppon talk about increas sanction which would supposedli forc Iran into concess But I rare hear them explain how that will work given the intern polit of Iran Seem more like to me that scuttl thi deal and pass more sanction would devast Iranian Presid Rouhani and Iranian Foreign Minist Zarif polit Rouhani wa elect to improv the economi torpedo the deal would make him a failur That would empow those hardline oppon who never want ani deal Beyond that what basi is there to believ European and Asian countri which have strong econom interest in Iran will maintain sanction indefinitely? The lesson of Iraq in the 1990s is that sanction erod over time British and German diplomat have warn that if the U S destroy the deal sanction could unravel So whi should we believ econom pressur will go up and lead to more Iranian concessions? Seem at least as like to me that econom pressur will go down
p19
sI19
V I also don t feel that oppon of the deal who wax moralist about Obama s failur to be vocal enough in support the Green Revolut have grappl much publicli with what appear to be the overwhelm support of Iranian dissid for thi deal If we believ that ultim the most import thing is the potenti for polit chang in Iran and the peopl who would make that chang want thi deal doesn t that carri real weight? I m not say thi deal will bring polit chang anytim soon Obvious nobodi know if it will Call me cynic but seem to me that hawk like use the Iranian dissid when it help them argu for a cold war postur But the minut it doesn t they pretend those dissid don t exist

V The Unit State did not negoti the way peopl negoti to get the best deal obtain It signal from the start of the talk that it regard the militari option supposedli alway the table" as in fact unthink It collar Congress to prevent imposit of new sanction when the Iranian act balki It wa a mistak too to send the secretari of state to head the deleg especi a secretari of state who had been a presidenti nominee: Secretari Kerri wa too big to be allow to fail Hi Iranian counterpart by contrast could easili be disavow by a regim whose suprem author alway maintain a wide distanc from the talk

p33

V Claim negoti agreement undercut America s abil to use forc s histori of negoti and agreement over weapon of mass destruct with enemi power sinc the end of World War II make clear that deal to constrain nuclear weapon are not an altern to militari econom polit and covert instrument in geopolit competit Instead they are one strand of a coher comprehens strategi for protect and advanc American nation interest

V Whi the Iran Deal Make Obama s Critic So AngryThis is not my conclus onli It is the judgment of the individu who arguabl know the most about use militari forc to prevent state from acquir nuclear weapon As a young soldier in the Isra Air Forc Amo Yadlin wa one of the pilot who drop the bomb that destroy Iraq s Osirak reactor in 1981 As Israel s head of militari intellig he design the attack that destroy Syria s nuclear plant and develop capabl and plan for attack Iran s nuclear program Assess the paramet of the framework agreement that Iran and world power struck in April Yadlin wrote M ilitary action against the Iranian nuclear program in 2025 would in all probabl not be much more complic or difficult than in 2015 T he Iranian program will be reduc compar to what it is today intellig about it will be better and it will be less immun than it is at present
p36
sI36
V Much ink ha alreadi been spill over the implic of a nuclear deal with Iran for that countri s assert region behavior Arab state and Israel warn of Iranian hegemoni and demand assert American engag to back But the one place where they are most interest in see step up American engag is the one place where Presid Obama is least like to indulg them Syria And fear of Iran and American withdraw Arab state are increasingli dug in against do the two thing that more than ani other could help gird the Middl East against greater Iranian influenc resolv the Arab world s bitter civil war and strengthen the resili of Arab societi As a result I don t expect that thi nuclear agreement will make much differ one way or the other in the chaotic and increasingli violent region pictur
p37
sI37
V In hi remark thi morn Presid Obama himself hasten to say that hi support of the deal t mean that thi deal will resolv all of our differ with Iran We share the concern express by mani of our friend in the Middl East includ Israel and the Gulf State about Iran s support for terror and it use of proxi to destabil the region

V Iran s region troublemaking is like to worsen regardless of a deal
p39
sI39
V Iran s procliv for region meddl is longstand and the chaotic polit of the Arab world sinc 2011 ha given the Islam Republ unpreced opportun to insert itself into local polit in destabil way In my recent congression testimoni and in remark to the Herzliya Confer in Israel last month I explain my view that Iran s region troublemaking is like to grow wors in come year regardless of a deal over the nuclear program I said:
p40
sI40
V In fact whether there s a nuclear deal or not I predict we will see a more aggress approach by Iran in a host of arena around the region where the upheav ha given them greater opportun than befor
p41
sI41
V If there is a nuclear deal the hardline element within the Iranian regim those most oppos to a deal are also those with the greatest interest and invest in region troublemaking They are like to use their abil to make nois region to tri and compens for the power disadvantag they see inher in a deal and they are like to have a green light from the Suprem Leader to do so becaus he will want to compens them for their unhappi with a deal
p42
sI42
V If there s no deal on the nuclear issu howev then the Iranian leadership will want to scale up it region assert of power for a differ reason: in order to solidifi or even strengthen it current region power posit in advanc of whatev tougher American Isra Sunni Arab effort it anticip to contain it
p43
sI43
V I stand by that predict While sanction relief will give Iran consider more resourc it ha never lack motiv for it assert of power and it continu to face ampl opportun As my Herzliya panel partner Meir Javandefar reveal at the confer Iran s sanction induc econom hardship in recent year ha not prevent Iran from spend billion of dollar and it own soldier live keep Bashar al Assad in power So ye Iranian meddl across the region will get wors in the wake of an Iran deal but it wa go to get wors anyway
p44
sI44
V The real question about Iran s region behavior is not therefor whether a nuclear deal is too danger for the Middl East becaus it will give Iran more abil to make troubl Troubl in case you haven t notic is not lack in the Middl East and Iran is one major sourc though not to be sure the onli one The real question is what the Unit State and America s Arab alli are prepar to do about it Note that in my view America s Arab alli have an essenti role to play here independ of the Unit State Read on to see what I mean The region competit with Iran remain the highest prioriti for Arab state
p45
sI45
V My trip to Israel and the Gulf last month made clear that the broader region power struggl with Iran remain the singl most import consider for Arab govern not ISI and other extremist terror not the civil war eras state border and not domest instabl But I wa struck by how unidimensional my Arab interlocutor think is today about an Iranian Arab power struggl that s gone on as long as most of them have been aliv As they see it now Iran is the sourc of all instabl in today s Middl East: of sectarian civil conflict domest dissent And Iran s success rise or fall on the scope of American assert of power in the Middl East thu the US withdraw of forc from Iraq wa a signal error that cede that one Emirati said wa like the secur of the Gulf over to Iran
p46
sI46
V It is amaz to realiz the extent to which two decad of American militari engag in the Middl East have so thoroughli reshap Arab expect such that they now cannot imagin live safe across the Gulf from Iran unless the region is bristl with American troop And yet thi is their consid view And in the absenc of the American intervent they seek they are act on their own As I told Congress thi spring:
p47
sI47
V Our Sunni alli are alreadi up their effort in counter Iran region as the Yemen oper and the renew invest in the Syrian rebel demonstr Iran will have both the mean and the incent to respond in kind Thi is a recip for an escalatory spiral perhap most particularli in Syria and Iraq
p48
sI48
V What thi mean is that no matter how much the US govern assert it primari region interest in combat ISI and Al Qaeda our major region partner will remain resolut focus on the Iranian threat as their primari concern And it mean that in reassur and bolster it partner as part of ani Iranian nuclear deal the Unit State cannot limit itself to the nuclear issu or to tradit defens and deterr
p49
sI49
V No matter what equip or system the Unit State is will to sell to it Arab partner no matter what aid it is will to provid no matter what US asset the administr is prepar to base in the region our partner are look for a differ kind of reassur They are look to see the Unit State demonstr it recognit of Iran s troublesom activ around the region and demonstr it readi to push back against Iran s expansion around the region And the primari arena in which the Arab state wish to see that from the Unit State is in Syria
p50
sI50
V Of cours American retic in Syria is quit clear consist and support by a wide array of the American polit spectrum The Syrian arena is the one where the current US presid is least like to undertak ani more assert action to counter Iran though he is increasingli will to invest American power in counter ISI there So if they are count on American intervent in Syria to push back Iran the Arab partner are like to be disappoint
p51
sI51
V A nuclear deal doe not leav America s region alli helpless against Iran
p52
sI52
V And yet America s region alli should not therefor conclud that the Iranian nuclear deal leav them helpless against a loom onslaught of well fund subvers and insurg Even if the benefit to Iran from sanction relief amount to the estim billion sanction relief will take month even to begin and will take far longer to fulli play out That billion will not flow to Iranian coffer overnight and that mean that the Unit State and it Arab partner have a window of opportun to work togeth now to bolster their effort to contain Iranian effort and strengthen Arab societi against Iranian meddl
p53
sI53
V The measur the White Hous roll out after the US GCC Camp David summit are an import but insuffici dimens of thi approach ballist missil defens measur joint exercis border secur support and cooper on cybersecurity will all help to demonstr resolv and thu to deter ani escal by Iran of it effort at troublemaking in the Gulf But more can be done and not by Washington alon

V My hous wa rob some year ago one winter night when I went out and left the back door unlock The robber are guilti to be sure for their bad intent and for steal my stuff Mayb they would have broken a window to get in even if I had lock the door But although they are thoroughli bad appl I can t avoid my own respons for make it so easi for them carri out their nefari plan Now I have an alarm system and new lock that I use dilig
p55
sI55
V Similarli it s difficult but necessari for Arab leader to acknowledg that their and their colleagu fail help gener the expand opportun Iran ha found for troublemaking sinc 2011 and their action now can shape Iran s scope for troublemaking in the futur The fail govern corrupt repress and abus that produc the Arab upris and the brutal respons of some Arab leader to those upris spark civil conflict in Syria Libya and Yemen and ongo crisi in Bahrain fractur societi and open wide new window for Iranian influenc The sectarian rhetor Arab leader use to ralli their publics against Bashar al Assad at the outset of the Syrian civil war likewis stoke resent and rift against the Shia within their own societi

V Arab govern can turn the tide of region chao
p57
sI57
V Iran and more recent as bomb in Qatif and Kuwait show ISI are the beneficiari of these domest divis No doubt Iran wa look for such opportun and wa eager to exploit them But instead of continu to leav their door unlock the Arab govern still stand in thi chaotic region can do two thing right now to tri and turn the tide and in the process enhanc the prospect for more activ American engag in the region down the line
p58
sI58
V First they need to move urgent to push the Arab world s civil war toward resolut The fractiou parti in Yemen Syria and Libya are not easi to work with but Arab leader can ensur that their engag support diplomaci and negoti peac rather than exacerb divis among faction and prolong the fight Reportedli thi wa one agre upon agenda item at Camp David but the follow up ha been slow
p59
sI59
V Second Arab govern should urgent do what they can to strengthen the resili of their own societi and their resist to Iranian effort at penetr subvers and manipul The best way to do that is to act now to tamp down the rampant sectarian of the past few year and to replac it with posit effort at a more pluralist and inclus model of citizenship and govern
p60
sI60
V While individu cleric and Sunni movement may have their concern and prefer regard form of Islam the state must be resolut neutral in embrac all it citizen equal and must not just abjur but oppos effort by those movement to defin ani of their fellow citizen as illegitim foreign
p61
sI61
V Measur to ensur toler and protect for religi and ethnic minor within the Arab world will not onli harden these societi against Iranian subvers they will also margin extremist voic on the Sunni side who recruit for ISI and it ilk and they will strengthen the determin of these societi to resist the action reaction cycl of violenc that extremist of all kind tri to produc to further their own end
p62
sI62
V Presid Obama anger Arab govern by note befor the GCC summit at Camp David that their greatest secur threat may not come from extern aggress but from within their own societi Observ the natur of Iranian behavior in the Middl East those two threat may be two side of the same coin And if Arab leader fear the consequ of sanction relief for Iranian action they could seiz the chanc now to strengthen their own foundat and gird their societi against what is like to come
p63
sI63
V I ve resist the urg to comment much on the Iran negoti in part becaus I want to support a deal and now that it s been struck I do but with major reserv I can t help feel that we ve paid a tremend cost for what can onli be describ as a narrow if understand focu on the minutia of Iran s nuclear program includ extrem technic question about for exampl centrifug I ve found it hard to relat to thi sort of discuss becaus I ve never quit seen Iran s nuclear capabl as the issu Iran s nuclear program matter of cours but it matter more becaus of the kind of region actor Iran happen to be if Iran wa a U S alli and a democraci we d be have a differ convers Our Gulf alli for all their fault recogn thi For them thi Iran s destabil role in the region wa what worri them most And while they exagger Iran s meddl while conveni elid their own they were right to view Iran as a fundament neg forc in place like Syria and Lebanon
p64
sI64
V The Obama administr underscor time and time again that thi wasn t about Iran s other activ in the region: it wa about the nuclear program Thi I gather wa intend to reassur but it effect wa the opposit Sure ani Iran deal depend on the nuclear issu from everyth els but the problem wa that everyth els matter a whole lot and perhap just as much To the extent that a success deal and keep the European on board depend on the drawback of a deal were built in to the process These start assumpt did not start with Presid Obama but with Bush a fact all too often ignor
p65
sI65
V Administr can of cours and chew gum at the same time but that neglect the interrel natur of Middl East conflict The boutiqu case by base approach to the region that Obama ha champion sound smart and nuanc in theori a welcom respit Bush s self conscious grandios framework but if the Arab Spring underscor anyth it s that polit are rare onli local In nearli everi major crisi and conflict whether in Syria Iraq Yemen Libya Egypt Lebanon or Bahrain extern actor with region ambit have play an outsized even decis role
p66
sI66
V It s difficult to believ in the durabl of Egyptian authoritarian without understand Saudi Arabia and the Unit Arab Emir view of the Muslim Brotherhood as a transnat and not just a local threat In Iraq Iran seem like a potenti or actual partner in the war on ISI until you realiz that Iran is the determin patron of the Syrian regim whose brutal ha fuel ISI rise to promin Meanwhil the Obama administr s first" strategi against ISI seem reason until you realiz our oppon treat Iraq and Syria as a combin theater and that the fact that we don t put us at a profound disadvantag In short think that we can the Iranian nuclear issu or even Iran suggest a detach from the region s realiti as they re actual live
p67
sI67
V It is fairli easi at least for most peopl to actual walk and chew gum at the same time Do one doesn t affect the other which make it an inapt metaphor for policymaking The Obama administr s decis to focu on Iran s nuclear program and to a lesser extent the Isra Palestinian conflict meant that we could and would do less of other thing and do them less well Polit capit and bandwidth are finit resourc Policymaking is about to decid what to priorit particularli when the presid and a small coteri of close advisors are pull in seemingli endless number of compet direct
p68
sI68
V When it come to alli especi one that becom nervou rather quickli and act rashli when nervou you can afford to alien them but onli up to a point So you pick your battl We want the Saudi to limit their public critic of the Iran talk and to go along with them howev grudgingli We knew thi wa ask a lot which made it difficult to make other big ask on say put pressur on the Sissi regim in Egypt to be even just a tini bit less repress But it is perhap in Yemen where the most damag ha been done And thi isn t just about the civil war From 2011 onward we outsourc our Yemen polici to Saudi Arabia To correct thi we outsourc our Yemen polici to Saudi Arabia
p69
sI69
V It s no secret that our Gulf alli feel that we haven t done nearli enough to counter Iran s ambit in the region The fact that Obama seem to hold out hope that a deal could help rehabilit Iran both region and intern doesn t help matter But put that asid we do know that Saudi Arabia and other Gulf countri opt to launch a destruct intervent in Yemen at tremend human cost in part becaus of fear of U S disengag and nervous over U S polici toward Iran As Ken Pollack recent testifi to Congress: privat GCC offici make no bone in say that they felt compel to interven in Yemen becaus the Unit State wa embrac Iran rather than deter or defeat it American offici despit have major qualm about the intervent had littl interest in pick a fight with Saudi Arabia over Yemen when they were alreadi expend their polit capit to reassur the Saudi about the Iran negoti
p70
sI70
V Then there s Syria It wa clear from the start of the upris that Obama did in fact have a clear object minim U S involv as much as possibl But there are other place such as Iraq where the Obama administr wa pull back in despit or more like becaus of it best effort The unwilling to rethink Syria strategi in ani seriou way ha been reinforc by the momentum of Iran negoti Whi rock the boat and potenti provok a major intern incid when progress wa be made on Iran s nuclear program? Whi even take the chanc with so much at stake? moreov wa been built in to the polici process As the journalist Josh Rogin noted: Syria propos at State must go through the offic of the undersecretari for polit affair Wendi Sherman who is also the administr s lead negoti over a nuclear deal with Iran
p71
sI71
V On the specif of a deal I tend to think like mani that the U S made too mani concess without get enough in return Accord to the New York Time in the final day of talk a televis anchor on a hardline Iranian channel said: fact is Obama need thi deal much more than we do She went on: American presid need a victori and onli a deal with Iran can give him that They have retreat on sever issu and compromis on their own red line Whether or not thi percept is fair it s a percept nonetheless and percept drive behavior
p72
sI72
V Other have note that Iran due to it deterior economi need a deal more than the U S did Thi is almost certainli true But while Iran may have need it more the U S want it more or at the veri least seem like it did Some of thi to be fair wa outsid the U S s control The percept had alreadi solidifi throughout the region draw on 6 year of observ the Obama administr s handl of variou crise most notabl the back down from state lines" in Syria Alli such as Egypt and enemi such as Syria have grown confid that we ll blink first in a stare contest in part becaus we usual do Thi wa whi I wa skeptic that ani final deal could ever be the best possibl deal The administr ha had tendenc to misus and/or underestim it leverag in some of our most import bilater relationship As the negoti wrap to a close there wa no obviou way to address thi It wa too late We couldn t chang how Iran view the Obama administr
p73
sI73
V There wa a relat asymmetri dure the negoti As Pollack note don t think that Iran valu a nuclear deal as much as it doe it posit in these variou countri With us it wa the reverse: we care less about Iran s posit in variou countri and more about it nuclear program Thi too wa built in to the talk
p74
sI74
V Some are troubl that most peopl had strong opinion about the deal befor read the actual text of the agreement One certainli hope that legisl will eventu read at least some of it But the specif of the deal aren t ultim as import as the broader issu and implic and those aren t anywher to be found in the text Here I tend to agre with my colleagu Jeremi Shapiro who argu in April that that the devil wasn t in the detail The detail don t matter He goe on: heart thi is a fight over what to do about Iran s challeng to U S leadership in the Middl East and the threat that Iranian geopolit ambit pose to U S alli

V In other word your posit on the Iran deal is like to depend on how you view the Middl East and America s role in it more broadli If you see the Syrian civil war as a or even the core region conflict then you re probabl worri about the billion in potenti sanction relief Iran even we assum it choos butter over gun as American offici hope and use say onli 3 percent of that total will have billion more to prop up the Syrian regim and other region alli and proxi It also depend on your start assumpt about the natur of the Iranian regim Are Iranian leader and do you think it matter whether such as Presid Rouhani and Foreign Minist Zarif are empow over their counterparts?

V For me at least one other issu come into play and it s a factor which ha push me to be more support of the Iran deal than I expect to be It s strike how littl discuss there ha been about what Iranian think and want As small d democrat American should alway at least take into account public opinion in other countri Presum Iranian know their countri better than American politician do Accord to opinion poll a major of Iranian favor a deal We all saw the pictur of ordinari Iranian celebr the framework agreement in April Thi time around the regim ha been more care close off public space with hardlin warn of the danger of Iran Deal induc Importantli as Nader Hashemi note of the most vocifer defend of a nuclear deal with the West are Iranian civil societi and human right activist It make littl sens for us to say that an Iran deal will make progress on human right less like when Iran s own human right activist seem to think the opposit In a survey of 22 lead human right activist support for ongo negoti wa while over half believ that a deal would lead to a signific improv on human right in Iran Of cours they could be wrong but we shouldn t bet on that

V To be sure the link between a deal and the empower of Iranian reform as intuit as it might seem is far from guarante As mani have note conserv may be just as like to gain from a deal for ani number of reason What seem inescap howev is that the failur of negoti would have been a major perhap even decis loss for Iran s reformist trend Presid Hassan Rouhani who buoy expect with hi come from behind elect victori two year ago ha been lose popular and goodwil On human right he pledg to expand person freedom and broaden space for civil societi As for the economi it can sputter along as it ha but without sanction relief Rouhani s hand are tie Hi raison d etre then depend on a success deal Without one we would have like had more of the same: conserv in control and domin the countri s polit Now at the least there is a glimmer of possibl even if the road toward substant reform remain a difficult one
p78

V Take these variou and veri differ factor into account the deal is on balanc a mix bag I don t think an Iran nuclear deal deserv the near obsess focu it receiv from thi administr Too much wa subsum and compromis due to the desir for a deal an administr prioriti which took preced over nearli everyth els Now that a deal ha been conclud U S offici may have more room to maneuv Of cours the implement of a deal will still requir constant attent to say noth of the domest fight which is still to come But perhap at some point the U S will be abl to act and think beyond Iran s nuclear program and re focu attent on the broader issu and conflict in which Iran play a major role The U S will now come under pressur to or overcompens depend on your perspect It will need to reassur skeptic Gulf alli that it will do more to counter Iran s region design I agre with Ken Pollack that the best place to do thi is probabl in Syria As he writes: the aftermath of an Iranian nuclear deal final execut the Administr s proclaim strategi for Syria may be the best and onli way to regain control over the danger confront escal between Iran and America s Arab alli

V Thi sad conclus is unavoid The lift of crippl sanction which will come about as part of the nuclear deal struck in Vienna mean that at least billion a sum Barack Obama first invok in May will soon enough flow to Tehran With thi veri larg pot of money the regim will be abl to fund both domest work and foreign adventur in Syria Yemen Lebanon Iraq and elsewher

V It is hard to imagin a scenario at least in the short term in which Hezbollah and other terror organ on the Iranian payrol don t see a windfal from the agreement Thi is a bad develop in particular for the peopl of Syria Iran as the Assad regim s funder protector and supplier of weapon foot soldier and strategist is play a crucial role in the destruct of Syria Now Syrian will see their oppressor becom wealthier and gain intern legitimaci legitimaci not just for Iran s nuclear infrastructur which thi deal will leav in place Here is a bit of what the State Depart say about Iran s role in what might be the world s most aw war: 2014 Iran continu to provid arm financ train and the facilit of primarili Iraqi Shia and Afghan fighter to support the Asad regim s brutal crackdown that ha result in the death of at least 191 000 peopl in Syria

V Look It s My Name on Thi Obama Defend the Iran Nuclear DealAnd yet the deal though repres a moral dubiou compromis with a terror support theocraci might be from the perspect of U S nation secur a practic necess I m write thi just as the deal is be announc and I think it is danger to make sweep judgment about a complic document I ve onli skim And of cours there will be plenti of time in Washington over the next 60 day for sweep judgment But here is the most import question to ask go forward: Doe thi deal significantli reduc the chanc that Iran could in the forese futur 20 year is the time period Obama mention in an interview with me in May continu it nefari activ under the protect of a nuclear umbrella? If the answer to thi question is ye then a deal in theori is worth support
p85
sI85
V I have no doubt that thi deal isn t perfect I m worri in particular about the issu of intrus inspections: How much visibl will the Intern Atom Energi Agenc and by the way the CIA and other Western intellig agenc have into the Iranian nuclear program? How quickli will inspector be abl to visit site they want to visit? I m also worri about the time base rather than condit base lift of arm embargo the Unit State should never acquiesc to a flow of arm to a terror sponsor state and about Iran s abil to continu it research and develop on ballist missil and other aspect of a nuclear program I also believ that so call sanction are a fiction: The U S could reimpos sanction on Iran if Tehran cheat on the deal but it would be reimpos these sanction on what will be a much richer countri one that could withstand such sanction for quit a while

p88
sI88
V I mention Syria earlier as an exampl of a countri that could suffer under thi agreement Other Arab state are of cours under threat from an empow better fund Iran One countri that I think could conceiv conceiv benefit from thi deal is Israel It will face acut convent challeng from Hezbollah Iran s Lebanes proxi but Hezbollah will be oper for the time be at least without the protect of an Iranian nuclear umbrella If the plausibl case can be made that thi deal actual push Iran further away from the nuclear threshold and we ll have time over the next 60 day to test thi case then Israel will be better off with thi deal than it would be without it Unlik mani propon of thi deal I take the Iranian regim s threat to extermin Israel serious I m not sure base on my last convers with Obama that he fulli understand the depth of the regim s anti Semitism in part becaus the regim s anti Semitism is so absurdli offens and illog that the hyper ration Obama might not believ that seriou peopl actual think the way certain Iranian think
p89
sI89
V If I thought that prevent war air strike against Iran s three or four most import nuclear facil could have led to the perman de nuclearization of thi anti Semit terror state I might have consid support such a notion But I suspect that war would have onli acceler Iran s push for a bomb Benjamin Netanyahu Israel s prime minist play an absolut crucial role in motiv the world and the Obama administr to oppos Iran s nuclear ambit But he ha becom an impot player in thi drama in part becaus he seek a perfect solut to the Iranian challeng There is no perfect solut
p90

V I worri that Obama s negoti might have given away too much to the Iranian On the other hand Netanyahu s dream of total Iranian capitul wa never go to becom a realiti The dirti littl secret of thi whole stori is that it is veri difficult to stop a larg nation that possess both natur resourc and human talent and a deep desir for power from get the bomb We ll see in the come day if Obama and Kerri have devis an effect mechan to keep Iran far away from the nuclear threshold

V What is your impress of the agreement sign today by the Unit State UK Franc Russia China and Germani and Iran? Like ani other negoti agreement there are thing in it that are attract and thing in it that give one paus On the attract side are obvious the limit on the qualiti and quantiti of centrifug and the signific limit on the qualiti and quantiti of enrich uranium that Iran is allow to keep There seem to be arrang for inspect It s not quit clear whether there s a differ between and when necessari the presid phrase it and anywher but thi is to be determin But all in all what the agreement appear to do is provid fifteen year in which Iran doe not have nuclear weapon
p94
sI94
V should be care about predict or assum in ani way that thi will lead to a moder of Iran s behavior toward it own citizen or toward it neighbor
p95
sI95
V On the downsid is that signific financi resourc will begin to flow to Iran which they can use for ani and all purpos There is the lift after five year of an arm embargo and after eight year of a missil embargo Iran is allow to keep a lot of nuclear relat capac so thi is a far cri from what the UN and other initi said they want There is the possibl of noncompli But to me the biggest question mark and the biggest concern I have with the agreement is perhap iron not the possibl that Iran may not compli it s my concern over what happen if Iran doe compli
p96
sI96
V You don t think over the next ten year or so we can woo Iran into our Western bosom? I had assum that there is such a build up of interest amongWhat about the Unit State relat with Israel and with it Arab friend in the region? the Iranian middl class that thi Could you comment on a seemingli de facto allianc between Saudi Arabia and Israel? How do you think Obama handl thi whole negotiation? would lead to a warm with I gather from your comment that you regard thi as a lacklust agreement? the Unit State and that onc the current ayatollah pass from the scene that there would be a new open in Iran My concern is that Iran can start prepositioning centrifug after ten year and after fifteen year enrich uranium It could then prepar for a breakout There is noth in the agreement that say what Iran cannot do in ten year on centrifug and fifteen year on enrich uranium It simpli say that the addit protocol and the nonprolifer treati will pertain But there are no ceil on capabl So the real concern I have is less the strateg signific of Iranian noncompli than the strateg signific of Iranian complianc
p97
sI97
V There s clearli a hope or belief on the part of mani in the administr appar reinforc by the Iranian foreign minist that thi agreement ha the potenti to do just that To use former U S diplomat Georg Kennan s term some believ thi agreement ha the potenti to lead to a of Iran I call that wish think I can t rule it out I hope it s true But I for one don t see it If anyth the flow of resourc will work in the opposit direct Iran believ it s on someth of a strateg roll So I doubt that will happen But in ani event sinc we can t know I would simpli say it would be a mistak to in ani way defend thi agreement on the basi that it will lead to a chang in Iran s charact or behavior At no point over the durat of thi agreement ought we cut Iran ani slack on the detail of the agreement which affect capabl in the hope that somehow it intent evolv That would be a real mistak
p98
sI98
V I can t say you re wrong And I hope you re right But we do have the like success at the ayatollah level You have polit success in the cours of thi agreement You have the power interest group in Iran: cleric the Revolutionari Guard bazaaris and other You have class divis in Iran as we saw in the so call June 2009 revolut So I would again think ye it is quit possibl that some element of Iranian societi in the Iranian polit space will tri to run with thi agreement and to reintegr Iran with the world And I expect other will push back I don t think we can be confid that we know how thi will play out It is even possibl in the short run that mani in Iran s leadership will need to do radic thing simpli to demonstr that they haven t somehow sold out the revolut by sign thi agreement with the Satan So everyon should be care about predict or assum in ani way that thi will lead to a moder of Iran s behavior toward it own citizen or toward it neighbor
p99

V Thi agreement complic U S relat both with Israel and Iran s neighbor Even without thi agreement rebuild trust and confid with Israel would be a prioriti It may be imposs with thi presid given hi relationship with thi particular prime minist of Israel Benjamin Netanyahu Thi might be someth better left to Obama s successor Republican or Democrat But you need to reestablish strateg trust with Israel Becaus it is quit possibl that at variou moment dure thi agreement there will be either real question about Iranian behavior or simpli some veri tough issu in the region: the futur of Jordan stabil of Syria These are the kind of issu that requir veri close U S Isra cooper Just as tough is go to be relat with the Sunni Arab govern who from what I can tell at least in the case of Saudi Arabia seem to be more concern with Iran than with ISI
p100
sI100
V I don t necessarili share that strateg view More broadli discourag sever of the Arab regim as well as Turkey from what we might call against the Iranian nuclear program with nuclear program of their own ha got to becom an American strateg prioriti As bad as the Middl East is today one can imagin a situat that is even worse: A Middl East that ha multipl finger on multipl nuclear weapon would be just that
p101
sI101
V My own view is that it is more de facto than a real allianc I think it s overdrawn I m tempt to cite the enemi of your enemi can still be your enemi Just becaus the Isra and Saudi share some concern about Iran it is a bit of a reach that there is necessarili a major strateg overlap between the two countri
p102
sI102
V I have a mix reaction I ve negoti a lot myself So ani time you are will to sustain a difficult negoti that show a lot of stay power and commit it is a plu On the other hand I m concern that in too mani area we compromis more than we should have I would have earlier on establish some posit and gotten the European to sign onto them so they weren t unilater American posit For instanc the durat of thi agreement I still don t understand whi we were content with a ten year limit on centrifug and a fifteen year limit on enrich uranium when the Non Prolifer Treati is open end I would have said either open end constraint on the Iranian nuclear program or at least far longer durat constraint And if the Iranian said no and the Unit State and Europ were togeth on that then we would have been prepar not to have thi agreement So that s one area I don t understand the relax of the arm embargo after five year or the missil embargo after eight It just seem to me that a desir on our part to avoid either a total unconstrain Iran or a war propel us to go further than we should have on some of the compromis There were too mani area where we seem to split the differ rather than insist on someth closer to our posit
p103
sI103
V It s imperfect It doesn t solv the problem of Iran s nuclear ambit At best it buy us fifteen year It doesn t solv the problem in ani way of Iran s region reach If anyth it may exacerb that becaus of the resourc that will now flow to Iran financi as well as physic And it may complic U S relat with Iran s neighbor So my own view is that thi will lead to an Iran that is more capabl in some way than the current one It certainli suggest to me that we are go to be live with the realiti of Iran as a region power for decad to come I should add it doesn t preclud select cooper with Iran For all I know we could cooper with Iran in Afghanistan or Iraq or even Syria one day But it is import to view the agreement to judg the agreement on it merit and not to in ani way assum it will lead to a broader relationship with Tehran
p104
sI104
V If I could come back to one point: it is essenti that peopl focu just as much on the challeng of the scenario in which Iran compli with the agreement as the scenario in which Iran fail to compli And I am much more worri about the former That will pose the greatest strateg challeng To put it bluntli I am more worri about the long term consequ of Iranian complianc than I am about the short term consequ of Iranian cheat
p105

V IT WA historic: everyon can agre on that But wherea some say the deal done in Vienna thi week between Iran and six world power plu the European Union wa a breakthrough that keep nuclear prolifer at bay and begin to mend a 36 year feud with America other are convinc it wa as Israel s prime minist Binyamin Netanyahu say a histor mistake" that set up Iran as a nuclear power and financ it aggress abroad Which of those is closer to the truth depend on two things: the qualiti of the agreement and it effect on Iran s behaviour
p107
sI107
V With Iran backer as well as critic especi in America s Congress which now ha 60 day to scrutinise the deal both tend to laps into magic think The critic argu that if onli the world tri hard enough Iran would give up the gut of it nuclear programme But the regim see masteri of the nuclear fuel cycl as both a badg of nation power and insur against American militari attack so the critic risk hold out for a bargain that never come Backer play down the Iranian regim s antagon toward America and Israel it determin to exert influenc abroad and it willing to use violenc They place too much relianc on a transform of the Iranian regim that may never come about
p108
sI108
V With or without an agreement the world is stuck with an Iran that continu to run a big nuclear programme and remain slipperi and danger The real test of the deal is whether it is better than the altern It is
p109
sI109
V The critic are right that the agreement legitimises Iran as a threshold nuclear state If it keep it word and avoid further restrict on it programme Iran will have the know how and eventu the capac to arm itself Yet it will also face greater restraint than it doe today see articl Iran s abil to enrich uranium the fuel for a bomb and to develop a weapon will be sever constrain for somewher between ten and 15 year After that it will be subject to the full forc of the intern treati against prolifer The govern ha agre to intrus monitor of all it nuclear facil and to inspect on request of it militari site under a system of access" Sanction which are to be lift as a result of the agreement can be reimpos if Iran violat it
p110
sI110
V For those who oppos thi deal the altern are to wait for a better one or to go to war Some argu that sinc sanction won concess more sanction will win more concess Yet if America walk away now China Russia and the EU would lose faith in the process and sanction would crumbl instead Moreov to think that Iran would surrend the heart of it programme is a reckless gambl Threaten it would be more like to dig in it heel Iran s nuclear expertis ha grown sinc 2000 and would expand further still in the year befor talk were possibl onc again Delay could thu end up make an ambiti agreement even harder
p111
sI111
V Some critic may believ that attack Iran is the onli option But war is a poor form of arm control Even if America had the stomach for a month long campaign and even if it could take out all of Iran s mani nuclear site bomb cannot destroy nuclear know how Instead the programme would go underground beyond the reach of monitor An attack would thu be a rout to a nuclear arm Iran Should Iran dash for the bomb war might make sens as a last resort but that option will not disappear just becaus of thi week s agreement
p112
sI112
V But the deal bring danger that it backer are slow to acknowledg Although the economi is hard press Iran devot preciou resourc to Iraq and Syria it sponsor Hizbullah the Lebanes militia cum parti and whip up emot in Bahrain and Yemen Reliev of sanction a richer Iran would sure spend money extend what is mostli a malign influenc Iranian violenc abroad may well worsen as a sop to hardline oppon of the deal in Tehran and as a gestur to show the world that Iran ha not gone soft The percept that the Unit State is a declin power which alarm Israel and America s alli in the Gulf may feed Iranian ambit
p113
sI113
V That is not the whole stori howev The nuclear deal bind Barack Obama America s presid into the Middl East Thi is hi foreign polici legaci and he is it enforc in chief just as hi successor will be Iran s is in turmoil roil by jihadists includ Islam State war with Saudi Arabia in Yemen and a fail regim in Syria Extra money will help Iran s effort but as America discov in Iraq domin is not determin by resourc If the Unit State buttress it oversight of the agreement with sustain region diplomaci need anyway after the Arab spring then it can help contain Iran
p114
sI114
V Although the deal will make Iran more power it will also lead the countri to becom more open As in China the Iranian theocraci rule over a popul that long ago lost it revolutionari zeal see articl The regim agre to constrain it nuclear programme becaus again as in China it calcul that it is more like to surviv if Iranian feel that they have a shot at prosper Unlik North Korea s Kim dynasti which cheat on it nuclear pact Iran s suprem leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei decid that be a pariah wa wors for hi regim than rejoin the world
p115
sI115
V That choic onli make sens if Iran can now attract trade and invest The more Iran trade with the rest of the world the more suscept it will grow to intern pressur As the countri becom enmesh in the global economi interest group will emerg within Iran s complex faction polit who will argu that the countri s futur is better serv by decent relat with foreign than by bad one The more Iranian benefit from tie with the outsid world the stronger those moder voic will becom

V The nuclear deal wa a victori for voic of diplomaci in Iran It wa also a victori for Iran s power Islam Revolutionari Guard Corp IRGC The IRGC wa never outwardli bullish on a deal but the critic of it top command with some except wa held to a low murmur Some pundit will point to that critic as evid that the IRGC wa against the deal from the start But that s incorrect Becaus without the support of the IRGC a deal could have never been reach
p118
sI118
V Now we should ask ourselv whi and what the IRGC s game will be go forward Sanction hit the IRGC hard and it is unsurpris to see that the organ stand to have mani of the sanction impos upon it lift as part of a deal Beyond sanction a deal also fit with the IRGC s strateg goal For the IRGC the nuclear program wa first and foremost about establish a credibl deterr against the Unit State The deal essenti take the option of militari action by the Unit State off the tabl With Washington no longer a threat the IRGC will be free to concentr it resourc on other enemi and strateg concern particularli in the region as even Presid Obama appear to acknowledg in hi news confer on Wednesday when he said there wa a that group such as Hezbollah would get more Iranian money onc it is freed up
p119
sI119
V That could be a problem insid Iran as well While Iranian Presid Hassan Rouhani see the nuclear agreement as a testament to hi govern s diplomat acumen the IRGC like see it as a victori of it polici of resist to the West And now new battl line are open up insid Iran between reform and hardlin whoever win that intern struggl will determin whether the Islam Republ emerg from it self impos isol and becom as a matur member of the intern commun or whether it continu to pursu it parochi polit of resist
p120

p122

V Intern condemn didn t stop the IRGC s aggress nor did sanction curb it assert That is becaus to the IRGC these action were essenti to keep pressur on it enemi They were an extens of it broader effort of establish strateg deterr against outsid threat especi from the Unit State and Israel Thi includ the IRGC s develop of client arm group in post Saddam Iraq which fought U S forc until their withdraw in 2011 and materiel support for faction of the Taliban in Afghanistan In other word the IRGC doe not view the nuclear deal to be a triumph of diplomaci alon Rather it wa the organ s forward lean postur against American influenc in the region that ultim compel the Unit State to rethink it approach toward Iran
p123
sI123
V For thi reason the IRGC like the Iranian peopl will have it own high expect for what should follow a deal With mani of the sanction remov against it and it command includ Qasem Soleimani who is accus of help Shiit militia in Iraq kill American soldier the IRGC will want to doubl down on it activ in the Middl East More resourc more fund and more option for procur and ad legitimaci will help the IRGC both arm itself and support it client The organ wa alreadi commit to secur it interest in Syria and Iraq the lift of nuclear base sanction and the open up of Iran s economi will undoubtedli strengthen the IRGC s abil to do so
p124
sI124
V The IRGC will also have interest at home There it will want to preserv the statu quo and safeguard it privileg posit in domest power polit It will not suffer the return of reformism or the polit of chang Thi instantli put the IRGC and the regim s broader hardlin constitu at odd with Iran s pro reform major Rouhani s govern will have to manag these expect in order for Iran s stabil to continu
p125
sI125
V Abov all the nuclear issu ha been a unifi forc in Iranian polit While there have been vocal critic of the deal critic in gener ha been kept to a low hum by the Suprem Leader whose unequivoc support for Rouhani s govern made the nuclear agreement possibl With a deal out of the way that unifi forc will disappear In order for Iran to gain strength from the deal it will need to stay unit Iran is surround by instabl The Middl East is crumbl sectarian is the new normal and Iran s Cold War with Saudi Arabia show no sign of abat Israel s govern ha alreadi reject the deal and will continu to seek way to undermin Iran s region influenc With the deal the Islam Republ can cross the Unit State of off it threat list But what it will soon begin to realiz is that the Unit State wa never as big of a threat as the regim s own divis polici
p126

V Reach the nuclear deal requir immens effort and polit will on the part the Iranian govern especi Rouhani and Foreign Minist Javad Zarif In the final push alon it took dozen of diplomat 18 day and countless bilater meet to reach an accord that all particip parti could support The result: a 159 page nuclear agreement between Iran and the P5+1 Make no mistake: thi is an histor achiev

V With or without an agreement the world is stuck with an Iran that continu to run a big nuclear programme and remain slipperi and danger The real test of the deal is whether it is better than the altern It is
p133
sI133
V The critic are right that the agreement legitimises Iran as a threshold nuclear state If it keep it word and avoid further restrict on it programme Iran will have the know how and eventu the capac to arm itself Yet it will also face greater restraint than it doe today see articl Iran s abil to enrich uranium the fuel for a bomb and to develop a weapon will be sever constrain for somewher between ten and 15 year After that it will be subject to the full forc of the intern treati against prolifer The govern ha agre to intrus monitor of all it nuclear facil and to inspect on request of it militari site under a system of access" Sanction which are to be lift as a result of the agreement can be reimpos if Iran violat it
p134
sI134
V For those who oppos thi deal the altern are to wait for a better one or to go to war Some argu that sinc sanction won concess more sanction will win more concess Yet if America walk away now China Russia and the EU would lose faith in the process and sanction would crumbl instead Moreov to think that Iran would surrend the heart of it programme is a reckless gambl Threaten it would be more like to dig in it heel Iran s nuclear expertis ha grown sinc 2000 and would expand further still in the year befor talk were possibl onc again Delay could thu end up make an ambiti agreement even harder
p135
sI135
V Some critic may believ that attack Iran is the onli option But war is a poor form of arm control Even if America had the stomach for a month long campaign and even if it could take out all of Iran s mani nuclear site bomb cannot destroy nuclear know how Instead the programme would go underground beyond the reach of monitor An attack would thu be a rout to a nuclear arm Iran Should Iran dash for the bomb war might make sens as a last resort but that option will not disappear just becaus of thi week s agreement
p136
sI136
V But the deal bring danger that it backer are slow to acknowledg Although the economi is hard press Iran devot preciou resourc to Iraq and Syria it sponsor Hizbullah the Lebanes militia cum parti and whip up emot in Bahrain and Yemen Reliev of sanction a richer Iran would sure spend money extend what is mostli a malign influenc Iranian violenc abroad may well worsen as a sop to hardline oppon of the deal in Tehran and as a gestur to show the world that Iran ha not gone soft The percept that the Unit State is a declin power which alarm Israel and America s alli in the Gulf may feed Iranian ambit
p137
sI137
V That is not the whole stori howev The nuclear deal bind Barack Obama America s presid into the Middl East Thi is hi foreign polici legaci and he is it enforc in chief just as hi successor will be Iran s is in turmoil roil by jihadists includ Islam State war with Saudi Arabia in Yemen and a fail regim in Syria Extra money will help Iran s effort but as America discov in Iraq domin is not determin by resourc If the Unit State buttress it oversight of the agreement with sustain region diplomaci need anyway after the Arab spring then it can help contain Iran
p138
sI138
V Although the deal will make Iran more power it will also lead the countri to becom more open As in China the Iranian theocraci rule over a popul that long ago lost it revolutionari zeal see articl The regim agre to constrain it nuclear programme becaus again as in China it calcul that it is more like to surviv if Iranian feel that they have a shot at prosper Unlik North Korea s Kim dynasti which cheat on it nuclear pact Iran s suprem leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei decid that be a pariah wa wors for hi regim than rejoin the world
p139
sI139
V That choic onli make sens if Iran can now attract trade and invest The more Iran trade with the rest of the world the more suscept it will grow to intern pressur As the countri becom enmesh in the global economi interest group will emerg within Iran s complex faction polit who will argu that the countri s futur is better serv by decent relat with foreign than by bad one The more Iranian benefit from tie with the outsid world the stronger those moder voic will becom
p140
sI140
V A countri of Iran s size and sophist will get a bomb if it realli want one Noth can chang that But thi pact offer the chanc of hold Iran back and shift it cours The world should embrac it cautious
p141
sI141
V There s alreadi a lot of commentari out there on the Iranian nuclear deal offici term the Joint Comprehens Plan of Action or JCPOA and there s sure to be lot more come in the next few day But what doe the deal actual do? You know what s in that veri long and veri dens document the parti have agre to?
p142
sI142
V Iran and the P5+1 US Franc Germani UK China Russia and the EU have been negoti at breakneck speed and understand make the text clear and user friendli wa not a top prioriti for ani of the negoti Much of it is unclear and duplicative and a complic web of intertextual refer and citat make for difficult read
p143
sI143
V Don t worri though: We live to serv Here s a comprehens summari
p144
sI144
V The document begin with a Prefac which is pretti much what you d expect contain veri gener languag about the broad purpos of the JCOPA: to that Iran s nuclear programme will be exclus peac and to the comprehens lift of all UN Secur Council sanction as well as multilater and nation sanction relat to Iran s nuclear programme
p145
sI145
V It next move on to a Preambl Gener Provis which provid the principl that the rest of the agreement s text will fill out: The deal will ensur the peac natur of the Iranian nuclear program and is to be endors by the UN Secur Council Thi UNSC resolut will provid for termin of all UN sanction relat to the the nuclear issu on Day" the day the IAEA certifi Iranian complianc with a subset of it oblig and conclus of UNSC consider of the Iranian nuclear issu a littl over ten year from now on what the deal call with somewhat Schwarzeneggerian overton Day"
p146
sI146
V Iran reaffirm it will never develop or acquir ani nuclear weapon In turn the P5+1 agre that all sanction relat to Iran s nuclear program will be lift and that they will refrain from impos discriminatori regulatori and procedur requir in their place Although Iran is recogn as have all the standard NPT right and oblig of a non nuclear state the agreement s provis stipul that the JCPOA s provis should not be view as preced for interpret intern law agreement or the NPT
p147
sI147
V A Commission" consist of eight member US UK Franc Germani China Russia Iran and the EU will be creat to monitor implement and resolv disput The P5+1 will also meet with Iran at the ministeri level everi two year or earlier if need Addit these same power will cooper with Iran the field of peac use of nuclear energy" and determin civil nuclear cooper project
p148
sI148
V The next section entitl Nuclear togeth with Annex materi that it refer provid the meat of Iran s oblig under the deal
p149
sI149
V With respect to Enrich Enrich R&D Stockpiles" the section requir that there will be agre limitations" on uranium enrich activ and R&D for eight year Afterward Iran s enrich will primarili be bound by voluntari commit that will be submit to IAEA as part of it provision implement of the Addit Protocol thi submiss must occur prior to Implement Day For 15 year all test with uranium and uranium enrich will occur exclus in Natanz and enrich will onli be up to 3 67 percent enough for civilian use Iran s total stockpil of enrich uranium will remain under 300 kg of 3 67 percent and the excess will be sold The agreement also goe into extens detail about how and where variou sort of equip must be store within Natanz
p150
sI150
V For ten year Iran s limit enrich program will continu exclus with 5 060 activ centrifug all of the simplest IR 1 model and all oper in Natanz If ani of these break Iran may replac them with replac of the same model All excess and damag centrifug and equip will be store under continu monitor by the IAEA also at Natanz Dure these ten year Iran can also continu research and develop R&D enrich with exist more advanc centrifug but can onli continu test two of each model For the bulk of these ten year Iran will also be larg restrict from creat more centrifug After eight and a half year these restrict begin to laps The number of activ advanc centrifug jump to thirti and Iran can start produc more to be kept incomplet and under IAEA monitor for the remain year and a half and eventu brought into oper need
p151
sI151
V While all enrich is take place at Natanz Fordow a formerli secret facil reveal by Western intellig in 2009 will be convert into a physic and technolog centre Intern collabor will be establish for joint area of research and the Joint Commiss will be told in advanc of the project that will be pursu there The IAEA will design the amount of uranium that can remain at the plant from past oper and inspector will have daili access to the plant for 15 year
p152
sI152
V Similarli for 15 year no uranium enrich will take place at Fordow and no nuclear materi will be present For the same period onli 1044 IR 1 centrifug in six cascad will remain at Fordow Two of these cascad will spin without uranium and will be transit to stabl isotop product The rest will remain idl All other infrastructur particularli connect and pipework that could allow these centrifug to be use for enrich of weapon grade uranium will be remov and store under IAEA continu monitor at Natanz
p153
sI153
V With respect to Arak Heavi Water and Fuel Reprocess Iran commit to redesign Arak as a modernised heavi water research reactor for industri and medicin research A Work Group of the P5+1 will help with both the redesign and the implement of the redesign includ technic financi support and facilit the sale and transfer of necessari materi although Iran will take the lead The redesign reactor will not produc weapon grade plutonium normal operation" and will minim product of plutonium altogeth The design must be agre on by the Joint Commiss and the IAEA will monitor construct
p154
sI154
V The redesign reactor will use specifi measur of uranium and the fuel design will need to be review and approv by the Joint Commiss Certain exist materi such as natur uranium pellet and IR 40 fuel assembl will be place under continu monitor until they can be convert All spent fuel for the lifetim of the reactor will be ship out of countri The reactor will oper under IAEA monitor
p155
sI155
V For 15 year other than Arak there will be no addit heavi water reactor or accumul of heavi water and all excess heavi water as defin explicitli in the deal will be made avail for export Iran will report on thi to the IAEA which will have access in order to verifi For the same period Iran will not acquir do ani reprocess or relat activ except for a veri specif few Accord to the deal Iran also not intend to thereafter" do so either The forc of thi languag is unclear it also seem less strict the Lausanne languag that ha commit indefinit to not conduct reprocess or reprocess research and develop on spent nuclear fuel
p156
sI156
V The next section lay out a seri of Transpar and Confid Build Measur Over the next few month Iran will provision appli the Addit Protocol allow for increas inspect and fulli implement both modifi code 3 1 oblig Iran to disclos new nuclear facil befor construct start and the Roadmap for Clarif of Past and Present Outstand Issu The IAEA will have to verifi that these as well as other measur have been complet in order to trigger Day
p157
sI157
V In the time frame specifi start on Adopt Day and continu for variou period of between 8 year and 25 year Iran will allow the IAEA to both monitor the implement of the voluntari measur and to implement transpar measur that include:
p158
sI158
V contain and surveil of centrifug rotor and bellow and
p159
sI159
V a reliabl mechan to ensur speedi resolut of IAEA access concern
p160
sI160
V Iran will also to obtain parliamentari ratif and thu formal conclud the Addit Protocol Thi last action will either occur by or begin on Transit Day The languag is unclear
p161
sI161
V For an unspecifi durat of time Iran also agre not to engag in activ includ at the research and design level that could contribut to the develop of a nuclear explos devic Such activ includ develop or use explos driven neutron sourc or comput model to simul nuclear explos devic Iran also agre to cooper with and act in accord with the procur channel specifi in the JCPOA i e under the oversight and approv of the Joint Commiss when obtain certain sensit nuclear relat materi
p162
sI162
V Those are Iran s oblig under the agreement Here s what Iran get in return The main benefit involv Sanction relief On Implement Day i e simultan with IAEA verif that Iran ha met certain preliminari oblig the UN Secur Council will all sanction relat to the Iranian nuclear issu impos from from 2006 2015 Similarli the EU will termin all of it econom and financi sanction and US sanction waiver and suspens will take effect Thi wave of relief will includ suspens of sanction relat to:
p163
sI163
V financi bank and transact with Iranian institut
p164
sI164
V After eight year or when the IAEA reach the Broader Conclus whichev is earlier the EU will termin all prolifer relat sanction and the US will termin or modifi sanction prevent Iran s acquir nuclear relat commod and servic translation: ballist missil At thi time the US s approach to Iran s nuclear activ must be consist with the U S approach to other non nuclear weapon state The Unit State must also make everi effort to encourag offici at the state or local level to take into account the chang in the U S polici and to lift their own sanction regim
p165
sI165
V Both the Unit State and the EU will refrain from re introduc or re impos the sanction that they termin as a result of the JCPOA There will also be no new nuclear relat UN Secur Council sanction and no new EU or U S sanction Presum the US and EU could still impos new even ident sanction on Iranian individu or institut for reason unrel to the nuclear program e g an upsurg in Iranian support for terror
p166
sI166
V Crucial howev the agreement also recogn that ha state that it will treat such a re introduct or re imposit of the sanction as ground to ceas perform it commit under thi JCPOA in whole or in part Thi seem to acknowledg that as long as Iran compli with the deal the US and EU will like be veri hesit to impos new sanction irrespect of other behavior
p167
sI167
V The EU EU Member State and US will also issu clear public guidanc about the sanction relief and will refrain from ani polici intend to advers affect the normal of trade and econom relat with Iran They commit to engag in joint project with Iran includ through IAEA cooper project in the field of peac nuclear technolog These joint project include: nuclear power plant research reactor fuel fabric agre joint advanc R&D such as fusion establish of a region nuclear medic center personnel train nuclear safeti and secur and environment protect Iran and these countri will also agre on step to ensur Iran s access in area of trade technolog financ and energi
p168
sI168
V The deal then lay out an Implement Plan which list the five for implement of JCPOA commitments:
p169
sI169
V Final Day: The day the agreement is reach and is endors by Iran and the P5+1: Juli 14 2015 The deal is submit to the UNSC and the EU Council and Iran and the IAEA begin work on transpar arrang Particip in the agreement will necessari arrang and preparations" to implement their commit on Day
p170
sI170
V Adopt Day: 90 day after the UNSC vote to endors the JCPOA pass resolut that will on Implement Day lift all nuclear relat sanction on Iran Adopt Day can also come earlier by mutual agreement of the parti Iran provision appli the Addit Protocol allow for increas inspect fulli implement modifi code 3 1 oblig Iran to disclos new nuclear facil befor construct start and provid certain inform in write to the IAEA about issu The EU and US Presid will pass those regul and issu those waiver necessari to begin sanction relief on Implement Day Iran and the P5+1 begin discuss on a document defin their respect role in the transit of the Arak Heavi Water Reactor
p171
sI171
V Implement Day: The day the IAEA certifi that Iran ha conform to a specifi signific subset of it oblig e g implement chang at Arak cap enrich capac provision implement the Addit Protocol etc Simultan with the IAEA certif previous issu EU regul UN Secur Council resolut and US presidenti waiver will take effect provid Iran with sweep sanction relief Sanction that expir on Implement Day include: restrict on bank transfer loan insur US currenc trade oil ga transport ship and metal design individu and compani and automobil
p172
sI172
V Transit Day: Either 8 year after Adopt Day or when the IAEA and UNSC reach the Conclusion" that Iran s nuclear program is entir peac whichev is first Iran will parliamentari ratif and therebi formal the Addit Protocol The US will legisl action to lift remain sanction particularli under the Iran North Korea and Syria Nonprolifer Act on the acquisit of nuclear relat commod and servic for nuclear activ contempl in the JCPOA The EU will also lift further sanction in particular sensit nuclear activities" i e sanction relat to ballist missil
p173
sI173
V Termin Day: 10 year from Adopt Day The UN Secur Resolut endors the JCPOA will termin The EU will termin all remain sanction
p174
sI174
V The agreement also contain a Disput Resolut Mechan Under the mechan both Iran and ani member of the P5+1 can refer complaint over the other side s not meet it JCPOA commit to the Joint Commiss The Joint Commiss would have 15 day to resolv the issu unless time period wa extend by consensu If the Joint Commiss fail to resolv the issu the issu could be refer to of Foreign Affair who would also have 15 day to resolv Either altern to or simultan with the Minist of Foreign Affair stage the issu could also be refer to an Advisori Board consist of three member one appoint by each parti in the disput and one appoint by an independ parti The Board would also have 15 day to review the disput If the disput remain unresolv the Joint Commiss will have five day to review the opinion of the Board and attempt to resolv the issu
p175
sI175
V If the issu is still unresolv after thi process the parti bring the complaint can ceas perform it commit under the JCPOA or notifi the UN Secur Council that the other parti is involv in non perform The UN Secur Council would then have 30 day to vote on whether to continu lift sanction Unless it adopt a resolut to continu sanction relief provis of the old UN Secur Council Resolut initi lift on Implement Day would be re impos The Secur Council will into account" the view of the state involv in the disput and of the Advisori Board
p176
sI176
V There seem to be some inartful languag here impli that the UNSC might both fail to pass a resolut on continu sanction lift and prevent sanction to be reinstated: the resolut describ abov continu sanction suspens ha not been adopt within 30 day of the notif then the provis of the old UN Secur Council resolut would be re impos unless the UN Secur Council decid otherwis Thi last claus is either duplicative or is referenc some other unforeseen action
p177
sI177
V Final the text onc again acknowledg omin that ha state that if sanction are reinstat in whole or in part Iran will treat that as ground to ceas perform it commit under thi JCPOA in whole or in part
p178
sI178
V After the main text the agreement contain a number of annex which expand upon the compon of the main text ANNEX I: NUCLEAR RELAT MEASUR offer a myriad of technic detail about limit on Iran s nuclear activ storag of it equip and IAEA inspect It provid detail about the develop and storag of centrifug the convers of reactor limit on enrich and more we have includ much of thi inform abov It also detail Iran s respons to begin implement the Addit Protocol Modifi Code 3 1 and the for Clarif of Past and Present Outstand Issu
p179
sI179
V Some of the annex s most crucial section concern the IAEA s presenc and capabl within Iran 15 year or longer Iran will allow the IAEA to use technologies" such as line enrich measurement" and will allow the instal of automat measur devic that will updat IAEA inspector on nuclear site Iran will also facilit a term IAEA presence" through the provis of visa and work space Within nine month of Implement Day Iran will increas the total number of IAEA inspector allow within Iran to between 130 and 150 For 25 year Iran also guarante the IAEA the abil to monitor and verifi the use of uranium ore For 15 year it guarante the IAEA monitoring" of store materi in Natanz For 20 year Iran will take specifi necessari step contain and surveil on centrifug rotor tube and bellows" that Iran is keep it agreement to limit uranium isotop separ relat research and activ to specifi method for 10 year
p180
sI180
V The annex also specifi the process by which the IAEA deal with question and suspicions: If the IAEA becom concern regard nuclear materi or activ or activ inconsist with the JCPOA the Agenc must notifi Iran of it concern at which point Iran will have the opportun to offer an explan If the IAEA isn t satisfi it can request access to the site in question and list the reason for access write though Iran may propos altern mean of resolv the problem If the side are not abl to reach agreement over access within 14 day of the IAEA s origin request Iran will consult the Joint Commiss to resolv the issu The Joint Commiss will have seven day to reach a conclus which Iran will then have three day to implement
p181
sI181
V Note that the Joint Commiss can on the necessari means" to resolv the disput either by consensu or by a vote of 5 out of 8 member which mean that the Commiss would be abl to reach a conclus even if Russia China and Iran dissent The annex also specifi that IAEA request for access must be made good faith with due observ of the sovereign right of Iran to the minimum necessari and not be aim at interf with Iranian militari or other nation secur activ
p182
sI182
V A final section bar Iran from particip in activ that could to the construct of a nuclear bomb: develop or use comput model to nuclear weapon develop point explos deton systems" unless approv by the Joint Commiss develop diagnost systems" or driven neutron sourc These prohibit are of unspecifi durat
p183
sI183
V Lastli the annex includ an extens design" for the redesign and reconstruct of Arak as a heavi water research reactor Thi outlin will provid the basi for the redesign that will be approv by the Joint Commiss and implement by Iran
p184
sI184
V ANNEX II: SANCTION RELAT COMMIT provid a comprehens list of US EU and UN sanction that will be lift by the deal Most of thi materi is includ in our summari of the section abov Includ as well is a set of attach list individu who will be undesignated at variou stage
p185
sI185
V ANNEX III: CIVIL NUCLEAR COOPER describ cooper between Iran and the P5+1 which can take place by mutual determin between the parti Bilater or multilater agreement that do not includ all member of the P5+1 are permit as long as they are consist with the JCPOA
p186
sI186
V Parti of the P5+1 will nuclear cooperation" with Iran in construct and suppli nuclear technolog facil and fuel particularli as regard the Arak Modernisation Project and Iran s acquisit of light water research and power reactor Iran and the P5+1 will also seek exchange" on nuclear research and cooper in develop and implement procedur in nuclear safeti and nuclear secur Thi section also dictat that the P5+1 will work with Iran on the and effici implement of IAEA safeguard and transpar measur Interestingli most of the languag in thi section make fairli clear that these project are larg optional: The P5+1 parti as appropri are prepar to cooper with Iran
p187

V ANNEX IV: JOINT COMMISS describ the stand bodi made of repres of the P5+1 Iran and the High Repres of the Union for Foreign Affair and Secur Polici an EU posit Thi last repres or her designee is the Coordin of the Commiss who appear to take a somewhat administr role although she doe not particip in decis activ relat to transfer of nuclear materi outsid Iran The Commiss will meet on a quarterli basi and at ani time upon request of a member Decis are to be made by consensu except state otherwis as is the case if the IAEA and Iran bring a disput to the Joint Commiss over unreport nuclear site and each repres ha one vote
p188
sI188
V The Commiss s remit is broad includ review approv and consult of numer aspect of the Iranian nuclear program and resolut of disput The Commiss is also respons for establish two Work Group one on procur i e sale of nuclear materi to and from Iran and one on sanction relief

V ANNEX V: IMPLEMENT PLAN offer an overview of what part of the agreement will be implement at the variou stage Most of the inform from thi section ha been incorpor into our summari of the Plan" section abov
p190
sI190
V Got all that? There will be a short quiz next period
p191
sI191
V An atom bomb can be made from two type of radioact materials: uranium or plutonium The talk were aim at curb Iran s abil to put these two element to use in weapon In each case the manufactur start with uranium ore Uranium mine from the earth is less than 1 percent U 235 the isotop that can be use to fuel reactor and make bomb Centrifug are need to separ the U 235 from the rest of the uranium in a process call enrich The other fuel that can be use to make a bomb plutonium is made by irradi uranium in a nuclear reactor The process transform some of the uranium into plutonium
p192
sI192
V Dure the enrich process centrifug are use to rais concentr of U 235 For most power reactor in the West uranium is enrich up to 5 percent Bomb grade is abov 90 percent and Iran had been process ore to 20 percent enrich The agreement Iran ha agre to transform it deepli buri plant at Fordo into a center for scienc research Anoth uranium plant Natanz is to be cut back rather than shut down Some 5 000 centrifug for enrich uranium will remain spin there about half the current number Iran ha also agre to limit enrich to 3 7 percent and to cap it stockpil of low enrich uranium at 300 kilogram or 660 pound for 15 year That is consid insuffici for a bomb rush
p193
sI193
V Iran wa construct a nuclear reactor at Arak that would have use natur uranium to produc Pu 239 which can fuel bomb The agreement Iran ha agre to redesign and rebuild the Arak reactor so it will not produc weapon grade plutonium The origin core of the reactor which would enabl the product of weapon grade plutonium will be made inoper but will stay in the countri Under the term of the deal the reactor s spent fuel which could also be use to produc a bomb will be ship out of the countri Iran will not build ani addit heavi water reactor for 15 year
p194
sI194
V More than twice the size of Texa in area Iran pose mani challeng for atom inspector who have to polic the agreement and gain access not onli to scientist lab and factori but also to mani underground site and militari base Western alli say the new inspect must be far more intrus than those in the past given the deal s sweep term as well as Iran s histori of evas stonewal and illicit procurements The princip concern are how to detect cheat and covert site The agreement Iran ha agre to provid the Intern Atom Energi Agenc greater access and inform regard it nuclear program and to allow the agenc to investig suspici site or alleg of covert facil relat to uranium enrich anywher in the countri Inspector will also have access to the suppli chain that support Iran s nuclear program includ uranium mine and mill and to continu surveil of centrifug manufactur and storag facil
p195
sI195
V The deal requir Iran to reduc it current stockpil of low enrich uranium by 98 percent and limit Iran s enrich capac and research and develop for 15 year Some inspect and transpar measur will remain in place for as long as 25 year Accord to Presid Obama: relief will be phase in Iran must complet key nuclear step befor it begin to receiv sanction relief Sanction for arm could be lift in five year ballist missil in eight
p196

p199
sI199
V The deal culmin 20 month of negoti on an agreement that Presid Obama had long sought as the biggest diplomat achiev of hi presid Whether it portend a new relationship between the Unit State and Iran after decad of coup hostag take terror and sanction remain a bigger question
p200
sI200
V Mr Obama in an earli morn appear at the White Hous that wa broadcast live in Iran began what promis to be an arduou effort to sell the deal to Congress and the American public say the agreement is built on trust it is built on verif
p201
sI201
V He made it abundantli clear he would fight to preserv the deal from critic in Congress who are begin a 60 day review declar will veto ani legisl that prevent the success implement of thi deal
p202
sI202
V Almost as soon as the agreement wa announc to cheer in Vienna and on the street of Tehran it harshest critic said it would ultim empow Iran rather than limit it capabl Israel s prime minist Benjamin Netanyahu call it a mistake" that would creat a nuclear superpow
p203
sI203
V A review of the 109 page text of the agreement which includ five annex show that the Unit State preserv and in some case extend the nuclear restrict it sketch out with Iran in earli April in Lausanne Switzerland
p204
sI204
V Yet it left open area that are sure to rais fierc object in Congress It preserv Iran s abil to produc as much nuclear fuel as it wish after year 15 of the agreement and allow it to conduct research on advanc centrifug after the eighth year Moreov the Iranian won the eventu lift of an embargo on the import and export of convent arm and ballist missil a step the depart chairman of the Joint Chief of Staff Gen Martin E Dempsey warn about just last week
p205
sI205
V American offici said the core of the agreement secur in 18 consecut day of talk here lie in the restrict on the amount of nuclear fuel that Iran can keep for the next 15 year The current stockpil of low enrich uranium will be reduc by 98 percent most like by ship much of it to Russia
p206
sI206
V That limit combin with a two third reduct in the number of it centrifug would extend to a year the amount of time it would take Iran to make enough materi for a singl bomb should it abandon the accord and race for a weapon what offici call time By comparison analyst say Iran now ha a breakout time of two to three month
p207
sI207
V But American offici also acknowledg that after the first decad the breakout time would begin to shrink It wa unclear how rapidli becaus Iran s longer term plan to expand it enrich capabl will be kept confidenti
p208
sI208
V The concern that Iran s breakout time could shrink sharpli in the wane year of the restrict ha alreadi been a contenti issu in Congress Mr Obama contribut to that in an interview with Nation Public Radio in April when he said that in 13 14 15" of the agreement the breakout time might shrink down to zero as Iran is expect to develop and use advanc centrifug then
p209
sI209
V Press on that point an American offici who brief report on Tuesday said that Iran s long term plan to expand it enrich capabl would be share with the Intern Atom Energi Agenc and other parti to the accord
p210
sI210
V is go to be a gradual declin the offici said the end of say 15 year we are not go to know what that is But clearli there are intellig agenc estim and one diplomat involv in the talk said that intern estim suggest Iran s breakout time could shrink to about five month in year 14 of the plan
p211
